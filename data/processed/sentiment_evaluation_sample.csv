B01N19UKLE,1.0,"I was super excited when I got this product but unfortunately, it does not work. It's a great idea since Apple has decided to be lame and eliminate the headphone jack.

B00MRL30N4,5.0,"I bought this to replace the factory stereo in my car. It has many good things and very few bad things going for it. First, the good.<br /><br />It was easy to install and easy to connect to my phone and iPad. When I start my car it automatically connects and starts playing where it left off. It has some cool options like different color lights for the display and buttons and the ability to have them change automatically. It plays CDs great and the radio sounds good. My rear left speaker was sounding bad with my old stereo, like the bass was distorted and it needed replacing, but when I installed this stereo the speaker sounds fine now.<br /><br />The bad? The screen is very small, I thought it was bigger based on the pictures. Also, you can't have the time displayed AND the song info, something my factory stereo could do. I hate not being able to see the time.<br /><br />That's it. A good stereo and a good price.<br /><br />--- UPDATE ---<br /><br />I figured out how to display the clock on the screen so it never goes away, and I can still see track and other info. I set it up with my phone so when I start my car it connects and autoplays the track my phone is on. It takes a while to download my phone info on to the stereo for calling, but once it's on there I can use the stereo to select numbers to call. The mic works great, no one ever has issues hearing me and I can hear them through the stereo speakers just fine.<br /><br />I love technology, and this stereo. After 6 months of use the only issue I have is that I could not find an install bracket that fit the stereo for my car, so it's not secure but it is snug and not easily moved around.",positive,positive
B08R7641MM,1.0,"First, mine didn’t smell.<br /><br />Now that I have the positive attributes out of the way let’s discuss why you should avoid this case.<br />I reluctantly paid $33 for this and I have to wonder what I was thinking. It’s nowhere near worth that much.<br /><br />It will not/cannot survive a side impact. Well that’s not true. It cannot protect your APM from a hit or drop that could damage them from the top. I’m not sure if it could from the bottom or sides. It’s either molded cardboard or thin plastic covered with fabric. No padding, just fabric.<br /><br />Internally there is another layer of cardboard (or plastic, thin, very thin) covered in a felt like material. There’s absolutely no drop protection.<br /><br />The magnets designed to put the APM into “sleep” mode lay flat. You will have to pinch them up while putting your headphones into it if you wish to keep them from clanging together and not using the stock case. Even then the magnets don’t work every time. See my pic.<br /><br />Overall this is a $10 case marked up cause they can. I mean we have expensive headphones so why not charge us more? We have already proven we will pay.<br /><br />Skip this thing. Mine is going back. If you want something to protect them in a backpack then still look elsewhere. You can get something equal to this for less.<br /><br />Thanks for your time.",negative,negative

B0B2HXJZ98,5.0,"I am no one's fitness freak at my age, but I do have things that I need to monitor for my continued good health. I decided to go all Samsung with this device cycle and I'm glad I did. I went with the Bluetooth only version because I always keep my phone on or near my person, and spending the money on an LTE capability and line for the watch does not make sense for me. Even without the phone line, this watch does just about everything but sign my paycheck. It's easy to set up and use. It interfaces well with my S22 Ultra and my Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, providing useful control of both. The available apps, faces and features should satisfy the most demanding user. Battery life is outstanding. I'm getting more than 2 days of continuous use on each charge. Charging is wireless and quick. If you have run it all the way down, it will take a couple of hours to bring it back to full charge, but a half hour will give you useful service time. I have picked up a few things that make my use nice and easy. You can read my reviews on them if you want. I cannot recommend this watch highly enough. Samsung has a winner here.",positive,positive

B0748JM8M5,5.0,I have had these since October.  The sound quality is GREAT!  Cancels noise around me when they are in my ears.  Battery is OK but not even close to what they say.  Maybe 4 hours with the charge in between.  Mine decided to rename themselves and then sometimes decide not to connect.  Kind embarrassing when I start the music and it's blaring from my phone and everyone around can hear but I can't and realize they didn't connect again.<br /><br />Update have had these over a year and seriously the best headphones ever.  After upgrades and set up again on my iPhone I have not had any troubles with sound or connection.  Battery lasts a long time and headphones never disconnect.,positive,positive
B07N5XKK95,3.0,"The ear pieces are not replaceable there are no different size tips for these so they fit or they don't. If they do they sound pretty good. Fit, for me, wasn't uncomfortable though I have worn earbuds that were much more comfortable. There's some good bass and the high ends are reasonably sharp. The mid-range isn't muddy though it's a little. . . in the back. I've used these for hours at a time even fallen asleep while wearing them. They're okay walking around the house, no idea how well they hold while running or exercising.",positive,positive
B0748NCPRR,1.0,Far too bass heavy; the sounds seem to come out like a rock. Jazz sounds like a drowning cat; anything with horns or strings just forget about...rappers will love this useless speaker as it muffles all hope of actual music.,negative,negative
B071R95N8P,4.0,"You will need a soldering iron, solder and a 12V power supply with a DC 5.5 connector.  I was pleasantly surprised after I have gotten through putting it together that actually does work.  This kit includes a stick of glue you heat up to attach the coil to the circuit board and thermal sink grease you apply to the back of the two integrated circuits.  This is a good thing to include because those can get rather hot.  The power supply I'm using outputs DC 12-volt 0.5 amp, which is just what I had on hand. It works all right even though a DC 12-volt 2.0amp supply is recommended.  I took off one star because the included 3 mm audio cable didn't work, but I had one already that I did use.",positive,positive
B010XHCQGK,5.0,"To say that I am pleased with this system is an understatement!  It arrived well-packaged and is easy to assemble.  The system features are more than I expected - Dual USB, Auto D.J., Bluetooth, and Wireless Sound Sync.  The speakers are crazy good and the Bluetooth capability is outstanding.  The only complaint is the CD player allows only one disk at a time however with the other features, maybe that's not so bad afterall!",positive,positive
B00DVFLJDS,2.0,"Update on 12/29/14...This was the biggest waste of money ever. It crashes regularly, sometimes hourly, at least daily. There's no seeming correlation between activity and crash, and it often happens when I'm not even using it. Screw this; I am done with ASUS......<br /><br />I'm on my second one of these, after the first was replaced. When it works, it's a great little device. Fast processor, better wi-fi reception than any of my other devices, brilliant screen, excellent battery life. However, this replacement has the same exact problem as the one I sent back: it frequently shuts down and restarts itself. It's not just going to sleep, but rather fully shutting off with a crack of the speaker and reload to the google screen. When it happens, all of the open/recent apps are cleared. This problem doesn't happen all the time, but when it does it will be a handful of times a day for a number of days...then it'll be fine for a couple weeks, then it starts all over again. It can be pretty infuriating, but i'm not using it for anything so critical that I'm willing to spend a couple hundred more for something else, or the same price for something that is inferior though more reliable.",negative,negative
B087JVV8FK,5.0,"Wireless headphones are all the rage right now, but sometimes I just want a good wired pair. When I'm using laptop especially, using Bluetooth headphones introduces lag and another thing that needs to be charged. These are excellent premium feeling wired 'phones that include an inline mic and controls if your device supports it. When used with my desktop that offers only a TRS plug (only two lines), it works as just a pair of headphones, with decent sound quality and bass response. On my LG phone or laptop which accept a TRRS plug (3 lines), the mic works as an input as well. My laptop didn't respond to the volume control buttons, but I think most phones will. Regardless, I'm impressed with the quality and presentation for the money this costs.",positive,positive
B08RY4XLSP,5.0,"My friends and I have had so many pool parties this year and this speaker has been amazing. The speaker is like having a full sound system out at the pool and it's amazing.

B00F54Y6GU,1.0,I chose these because of an excellent technical review I read on Amazon. Very happy now. They fit snuggly. Have a great sound. Easy to pair with Bluetooth.

B00M38O3JG,5.0,"I received this as a free review sample five and a half months ago and it's been invaluable. If your laptop has a fully functioning internal fan this array will augment that and keep your laptop cool even in unairconditioned spaces on a hot day. That will definitely prolong the life of the internal electronics and the hard drive.<br /><br />This fan array moves a lot of air, promoting excellent heat transfer. However, it can interfere with other USB peripherals if you power it directly from your laptop, and especially if you add even more peripherals to the ports integrated into this unit. That is because the power draw form USB ports may exceed the capacity of the laptop, especially if you are running it off an unpowered USB hub. I had that problem when I tried running this, a mouse and a speaker from my laptop. I moved this one to a powered hub and the problem was immediately resolved.<br /><br />If you are set in your ways regarding keyboard height know that this raises a laptop 1 3/8 inches higher at its lowest setting. For me it took a day to become accustomed to the raised typing height, but since it solved a genuine problem the tradeoff was worth it. Just know that you will need to adjust to that and it may slow down your productivity for a day or two.<br /><br />One final note: if you live or work in a high dist environment take the time to shut this fan array down and blow it out with compressed air. It will greatly prolong the life of the array and will also ensure that it doesn't become noisy.",positive,positive
B00J8DL78O,3.0,"This is a fun, useful tablet for the price. I love that you can make all different homepages. Love that you can pick wallpaper which you can't do with Kindle Fires which are the only other tablets I've owned. Of course, if you want a tablet<br />mainly for books, Kindle is the tablet you want. I also love all the apps you can get with the Samsung. What I don't like is the 8gb storage. I was under the impression if you got the 32gb  extra it would integrate with the tablet rather than just be like a drive for mp3s and such. 8 gigs is barely enough for the apps you need. Also the manual tells you nothing about how to add things to the extra drive.  Had to go to you tube. My tablet has connection issues from time to time.<br />I still really  enjoy it most of the time. It can be super fast and plays things well from the cloud. Very light and attractive.<br /><br />I am returning tablet. 8 gbs is just not enough. Extra storage cumbersome to use and doesn't work half of the time.  Not easy like the cloud. Speakers unimpressive. I am disappointed because I thought I would like the Samsung. Also a battery hog. Will try the nexus 7.",positive,negative
B002ZODFS8,5.0,This works great. We used this on vacation to watch a movie. Just plugged it into the iPad and both of us plugged out headphones into and voila.....great sound. Didn't lose any sound quality at all. It seems a little thin and I figured it would not last that long when it came but thought if it got me through the vacation I would be happy. That was a while back and it still is going strong.<br /><br />Best splitter I have ever had,positive,positive
B07ZWZZZ71,5.0,"I was happy with the quality of this microphone. It worked very well. It seems like a little nicer one. It was very sturdy, which was good, because some of these are so thin they constantly fall over. It has a good stable base.<br /><br />The sound was good. It picked everything up well. It was good for all the conference calls we are making now. I liked that it had an adjustable button. I felt like it was a decent value for the quality you get. I would recommend it.",positive,positive

B08H1T8CGP,4.0,"This is a decent black backdrop for use in studio setups for photography or video. It can be held up using standard equipment like a rod and muslin clamps. I found, however, that the material has a touch of a sheen to it. It isn't a huge deal and honestly can be easily worked around, but it seems to reflect a little more light back at the camera than other backgrounds if you aren't careful. For example, a hair light that I've used before on other backgrounds spilled a bit onto this and it made a visible area of the frame brighter. I had to use some larger barn doors on the light to deflect it better, but the point is a more expensive and professional level material might not have needed that.<br />For the budget I'd say it is still good and worth using to get a black background on the cheap.",positive,positive
B002GQRROS,5.0,These fit really comfortably in the ear and around it. I find that these actually want to stay in my ear unlike other earbuds and I love the fact they wrap around the ear because it makes them so much more comfortable to wear. They also have really great sound and works perfect with my ipod.,positive,positive
B09WDQ8X5J,5.0,The speaker is small and portable enough to fit into a large pocket yet can produce some very respectable volume with its 14W power. My daughter found this is a great way to turn a fanny pack into a hip-mounted sound system (she's a counselor in a summer camp and using this speaker a lot). The sound is surprisingly immersive and the fact that it is waterproof enough to use around the pool or in the rain is a huge bonus. Great speaker!,positive,positive
B07S1WVH4Y,5.0,I have other speakers from this brand- they are a great price with really nice sound quality- even when your outdoors.<br />I opted for this particular one due to the fact it looks like a rock 🪨!<br />It blends in nicely into our patio set up and the kids can hook up to it and listen to their music while playing outside.,positive,positive
B00E3EVXVY,5.0,"When I accepted a review sample of this holder I had visions of using it to entice my constant companion to sit in the back and play with her iPad. Indeed, this hooked right onto the two posts of the front seat headrest that would allow a backseat passenger to watch movies and do whatever else they use the iPad for. My companion did not take the bait, so I was left with a review sample that, frankly, I could not give away.<br /><br />Necessity is the mother of invention and the best use for this mount was in my music room. This hooks into my [[ASIN:B000CDUDQG Belmonte Orchestra Stand Deluxe Black]] to mount an iPad and still have room left for sheet music and a [[ASIN:0961470143 The New Real Book - Volume 1]]. I have uploaded customer-supplied photos to show how this securely attaches to the stand and holds an iPad in place (it will work with any tablet up to 10 inches.)<br /><br />I love how this holder allows you to place your tablet at practically any viewing angle, and also how it positively and absolutely holds the tablet in place. For the record, these claims apply equally to the dual headrest posts in my 2014 Outlander and to the music stand cited above.<br /><br />Personally, the manufacturer is missing a major market because tablets are now common on stages and in studios and I suspect that there is a much larger market for this holder than significant others who refuse to be relegated to the back seat. I am so pleased with this holder that I have already recommended it to fellow musicians.",positive,negative

B07P5R2D42,5.0,"IBI - THE SMART PHOTO MANAGER (US Version) makes it super easy to extract, back up, and share photos stored on my mobile devices.  Instead of emailing cell phone photos that I want to share among electronic devices (an iPad Air (3rd Gen), a desktop PC, and a Samsung Galaxy cell phone), I can upload the photos to Ibi via a network connection with only a couple of clicks in the Ibi app.<br /><br />No longer do I have to address an email, select and add the photos, send the email--and then reverse the process on a second device (open the email, download the photos, and save the photos to the device).  All that’s necessary is to take the photos, open the Ibi app, choose “import photos”, select the photos, and hit the import button.<br /><br />The photos are immediately uploaded to Ibi, and I can access them immediately on all of my other devices.  There is no need to clutter up email or to consume precious storage space on my mobile devices, when all I want to do is share photos.<br /><br />Ibi is extremely versatile.  It allows you to sort and organize photos, and create Albums.  It allows you to authorize certain people to email photos directly to Ibi.  It allows you to set up different areas of Ibi for the use of individuals.  It allows you to upload its contents to a PC or other even larger storage device by plugging in a USB cable (not included).  It even allows you to stream your videos to a television set (using Chromecast or Roku apps).<br /><br />Ibi is easy to set up, using Bluetooth.  My iPad and my Galaxy phone both found the powered on (plugged in) Ibi in less than 30 seconds.  Once set up, Ibi communicates via your home network’s Internet access.  When your Ibi app is set up, click on Help, and download the complete user manual (a PDF file).  The manual is easy to understand, and will enable you to get the most out of your Ibi.<br /><br />Ibi is a small drive that easily fits on a bookshelf.  It uses just one power cord.  I really love this Ibi storage drive.  It is simplifying my life.<br /><br />+++++IMPORTANT NOTE: You should NOT choose “automatic backup” in the Ibi app Settings until you understand how the app works.  With automatic backup enabled, Ibi will copy all of the photos stored on EACH mobile device, and you will probably get a lot of duplicate photos.  For example, if you have been sharing and storing the same photos on an iPad and a cell phone, Ibi will copy the photos from each device.  Worse, if you go into Ibi and delete the duplicates, Ibi will keep automatically adding the photos back as long as the photos still exist in storage on the two different devices.<br /><br />You will probably want to use “automatic backup” when you first set up your Ibi.  That way all of your photos will be automatically copied to Ibi to start you off.  But you should turn “automatic backup” off before you start deleting duplicate photos.  You will never have a problem with duplicate photos if automatic backup is turned off.+++++",positive,positive
B08QXFD2WQ,5.0,"I got this to replace a Toshiba fire TV that was showing it’s age. I didn’t like the fact that the Toshiba lacked some normal features that you would see on a normal TV like being able to adjust the aspect ratio. Crazy. It also came with extremely limited app storage and you couldn’t delete half the apps that were taking up the limited storage. So far the Google TV operating system seems faster and easier to use. The picture is gorgeous. I don’t have cable, so I rely on digital OTA channels or streaming channels. I had to tweak the color slightly for my taste, they had the oranges and reds boosted a little too much. But it’s really fantastic. The sound is really good too, although, I am not an audiophile, and I don’t rely on my TV as my primary music source like some people seem to do. It has a cool feature where the sound is customized to the acoustics of your room and your position in it. You run this calibration holding the remote at chest high and the TV plays some sounds that sounds like space invaders and the remote records them and adjusts the sound accordingly. Oh, yes, the remote has a microphone built-in do it so you can use voice search and other voice activated features. The TV was easy to set up, although the whole linking of the Google accounts and all the other things they want you to sign up for was a bit of a chore. I opted out of some and kept others. Your mileage may vary. The table top stand is the easiest to install that I’ve ever seen, you just plug it into the bottom and there it is. No dealing with screws or anything like that. There are a decent number of HDMI inputs and two USB ports, so that’s a plus. Finally, while it says you need to people, I didn’t have two people and it was not that difficult to handle the TV. You do need to be really careful not to press on the LCD, which is a given for any TV. But the TV only weighs less than 30 pounds so it was easy to carry. All in all, it’s a really nice TV. I think it’s a little pricey, but you’re paying for the Sony name. And it does appear to be excellent quality.",positive,negative
B001EYU3LC,1.0,"Not recommended for daily use, as durability is lacking...<br /><br />Vinyl ear covers on these headphones allow human sweat to build up around this area and find its way into the ear.  Previous model was better in this respect. Balancing of R and L headphones seem better, but N/C feature looses effectiveness as wear and tear brings a looseness to any grip around human ears.  Nothing from this system is expected to last more than 20 days of use. Expect failure soon after store warranty or sony warranty expires.  Not durable.  Not a sports headphone.

I immediately loved the simplicity, elegance, and convenience of the Kindle Touch 3G.<br /><br />My sole desire is to read books easily without any distraction by the device that I am using.  The Kindle Touch 3G is simple to use: ""intuitive"" is the word that ideally describes the operating features of this e-reader.<br /><br />You can swipe the page to turn (as with any paper page) or tap.<br /><br />Two toolbars disappear while you are reading, but both are accessed simultaneously with a simple tap at the top of the screen.

Both are easy-to-use:  just tap the choice you wish to make.<br /><br />You have only two buttons to click on a regular basis:  the on/off button at the bottom edge of the device and the Home button (looks like a tiny speaker) located just beneath the viewing screen.<br /><br />You must hold the on/off button for approximately 7 seconds in order to power-off completely; otherwise, the screensaver will appear indefinitely.<br /><br />Other features are available and are easy-to-master; however, you can begin reading out-of-the-box if you have a Kindle on your PC.  The system automatically duplicates your archived items.<br /><br />If you do not have a Kindle on your PC, you can begin reading once you register by entering the email and password that you use at Amazon.com.  It is VERY, VERY easy to register:  very user friendly.  The screen and enclosed guide ""walk you through"" the simple process.<br /><br />The Kindle Touch 3G is elegant.  I also bought the case ($39.99).  Together, the two items are almost as slim as a DVD and case rented from a Red Box.  The design is sleek, slim, and pleasing to use.<br /><br />Convenient? I found myself yesterday racing to an emergency room at my doctor's request.  While waiting to be seen, I pulled-out my Kindle Touch 3G, began reaading a Sherlock Holmes short story, and had ""no worries"" about battery life or connectivity.<br /><br />I heartily recommend the Kindle Touch 3G to anyone with an older relative who loves to read and may not have WiFi access OR who needs larger type in order to better enjoy the reading experience.",positive,negative

B00Q4KNP5C,4.0,"I'll get the things I do not like about the review sample that I received out of the way first so I can finish on a positive note. Basically these phones have a distinct bias towards the higher frequencies, with a crossover to bass in my right ear and flat mid range response. In other words, if you are a critical listener you may want to consider other phones on the market.<br /><br />I was able to get decent bass response in my right ear using my phone's EQ app, but could not get any decent mid range. The net result is music sounds one dimensional (even with the bass response in one ear.) I am guessing that the crossover threshold is such that you get high frequencies in one ear and low in the other, with the mid somehow cut out or deemphasized. For folks who listen to audio books and inspirational or educational material this will not be an issue.  I will say that even with the volume cranked the high end did not break up or become tinny.<br /><br />From a comfort perspective I had no problem wearing these for three hours with the medium buds that ship with it along with small and large ones. And I love the way they were securely held in place with the ear hooks.<br /><br />Another feature that I like is the cable is flat and tangle-free. Of course, the nicest feature is they are, indeed, waterproof.<br /><br />Bottom line: sound quality for music is lacking. However, if you are a casual listener and are into jogging, strenuous activities and wet environments these may be perfect. As much as I complained about the sound, I cannot find fault in the construction or ability to withstand harsh environments.",positive,negative

B00140DBRY,5.0,"I bought one of these from another company for around $25.00.I was hesitant at first because it's a lot of money for a radio that you can only use with a headphone or ear buds but i took a gamble knowing it's a brand name and i figured that if i don't like it, i can always return it.Damn...this radio sounded great & i didn't know at first but it has a stereo sound and not like one of those radios that sounded tinny w/ a lot of echos (G.E.Radios are notorious for this!) I decided to keep it and the channels lock-on in the push of a button if you set your favorite channels.I never regretted buying this and after 6 years of daily use and dropped it numerous times, it's durability still amazes me and the thing just works EVERY TIME! you cannot buy anything better than this radio for the price in my opinion...if you do please let me know but it has to be $25.00 & lower.Good luck if you can find something like a Grundig radio for this price(they usually starts @ $60.00 & above)...",positive,negative
B085NPCQLT,5.0,"I love these earbuds! I had been using the tozo T10s for about 3 years before I got these (those still work awesome btw) but the sound quality on these is unmatched! they sound really clear and the noise cancelling just adds to that. the noise cancelling could be a tiny bit better, but the transparency mode is where it really shines for me. even with my old ones (that didnt have noise cancelling at all btw) i always found myself taking out one earbud so I can pay attention to my surroundings, but with these I don't need to do that! I also appreciate all the extra rubber caps and the fact that its USB-c charging :) overall 5 stars and I recommend these to anyone who wants good sounding headaches to travel with or bring to work.",positive,positive

B09DCTN5ZS,5.0,"[[VIDEOID:9b88dadfbf58bb503f1928922845b685]] I ordered this dash camera after stumbling across a dash-cam video on the internet & realized I could potentially save myself a lot of hassle either in an accident or even a police encounter. I had one a few years ago when I had a long commute but these days I do most of my driving in rental cars & in unfamiliar areas I wanted something small, portable & quick to install. This camera just takes a second to stick to the windshield with the suction mount & it takes a mini USB plug for power. It comes with a 12V port adapter with a very long cord but I mostly power it with a short USB cord & my own adapter.<br />I'm very pleased with the video quality & sound. I have tested it with 1080p30 1020x1080 & 720P60 1280x720. Given the long record time with the included 32gb memory I will probably keep it at 1080p. The microphone picks up the sound of the turn signal switch which is good & also my singing to the radio which is bad.<br />I don't know how well the video resolution will come across in the attached video but I'm impressed with the image I get on my computer, especially files made at night. In reviewing the videos taken at 1080p (& with my filthy windshields), I have to be right behind car to make out its license plate. I have since maxed out the resolution to 1440P because of this but I'm not sure it made that much difference. The wide angle also tends to make things look further away than they are, the car in the last clip was much closer to my car than it looks in the video.<br />The included 32gb memory card holds over 4 hours of video at 1080p30 1020x1080 resolution & that's day & night. The camera will over-write files that aren't saved & it has a ""save"" button that stores files where they won't be over-written. The software also has an adjustable feature that automatically saves files where an impact is detected. In the 2 cars I have used it, a big pothole or bump in the road will trigger an incident on the medium setting (see my video). The camera will also take still a still picture when the impact detection is triggered or the file is selected for saving.<br />The camera doesn't have it's own battery but so far it has managed to save the last file if the car shuts off the 12v port or usb when the key goes off. I have mine to record short, 5 minute clips as a precaution against this, The clip length is adjustable up to 10 minutes. Without the battery, won't record any activity when the car is parked even if the car is bumped if the cord is not plugged into an active port.",positive,negative
B0047T79VS,5.0,"Range limitations notwithstanding, this receiver has dramatically expanded the usefulness of my Droid X by allowing me to play my music through my home stereo system, as well as through my friend's [[ASIN:B001DLTDQC Bose SoundDock Series II Digital Music System for iPod (Black)]] (using an [[ASIN:B000068O51 Hosa YRA154 1/8 Male To Dual RCA Female]] to adapt the Belkin to the Sounddock since my Droid will not fit the iPod cradle.)<br /><br />One reason I do not have a problem with the range is I am usually in the room where the stereo is, and sit fairly close to where I have the Belkin receiver located. And, with the Bose rig, that is for taking out to the patio or in the kitchen, so I am in line of sight and pretty close as well.<br /><br />The signal is consistently strong between my Droid X and the receiver, and the sound quality is more than adequate for my old ears. The only thing I would want is for the Belkin receiver to automatically connect with my Droid X in the same manner that the [[ASIN:B003PPGOC0 GOgroove FlexSMART X2 ADVANCED Wireless In-Car Bluetooth FM Transmitter with Charging, Music Control and Hands-Free Calling for ANDROID, iPhone, Blackberry and Windows Smartphones]] I have in my car does. As it stands, I always have to go into my Droid's settings and manually connect the paired Belkin before I can transmit my music stream to it.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased with this receiver and intend to purchase two more (one for a PA system I own, and a dedicated one for the Bose Sounddock.)",positive,positive
B007ZG03DG,4.0,"I purchased this for [[ASIN:B011IH6MBO Bose Wave Music System IV]] so that I could wirelessly stream music, movie sound, etc. from smartphone, tablet, laptop, or other Bluetooth device.<br /><br />Setup was easy.  All I had to do was plug it into the Bose Link port.<br /><br />Since this external adapter can only pair one Bluetooth device at a time, I had to turn the Bose on, then press AUX to cycle it to Bluetooth. Once there, I pressed the 5 button to make it discoverable. Since it remembers the last device I paired, I did not have to make it discoverable again. However, if I wanted to pair a new device, I had to press the 6 key until the unit beeped (about 10 seconds) and then it would clear the Bluetooth memory and become discoverable again.<br /><br />One negative I did see with the external adapter is that the volume is about half that with Bluetooth enabled. What I mean by this is that a volume of 30 on the radio sounds like 15 when paired with Bluetooth. I found that I had to double the volume when using this adapter.<br /><br />In summary, it works even if it is a bit cumbersome to get use to and the volume requires an increase.",positive,negative
B00BB5WC8Q,5.0,"I couldn't wait to get this! I had the PS-100 for several years and loved it, wore it out! So I stuck with the brand.

B07DLT74H3,3.0,"My original Echo, purchased when the first invitations were sent out, was much beloved for years. She finally began to have performance problems last month. Stuttering, failing to perform tasks and simply not hearing her name anymore. Definitely time for an upgrade.<br /><br />I like this Echo Plus, but I'm not thrilled with the short, fat, squatty shape over the tall, slender original Echo. This one doesn't fit in the same spot and just looks like any generic, knockoff speaker rather than Alexa. However,  the sound quality of music and Audible books is superior and can be clearly heard at lower volumes than my old Echo.<br /><br />I will say the coordination/communication between the physical Plus and the Alexa app is spotty and slow. In particular when using the Plus's built in temperature monitor. I had hoped specifically to use this to monitor our RV temperature when traveling for the safety of our dogs. Alexa does tell me the temperature has reached the preset warning level - an HOUR later!!! That's useless. I ended up spending more money to but a dedicated Wifi temperature/humidity  monitor that alerts my phone via text and email literally within 90 seconds of the preset parameters. I love Alexa in general and we have 3 Dots, the Auto and this Plus, so we're fully integrated in the ecosystem, but this Plus isn't as good as the original, 1st generation Echo.",positive,negative

Volume is louder than any other earbuds ever used and fit allows for noise to be isolated (best alternative to true noise cancellation) - actually takes some getting used to when you put these in and the outside world noise goes away.  Very similar to in-ear studio monitors.  Only complaint is they don't always pair the microphone which can be troublesome when trying to take a call, though the sound always pairs.",positive,positive

The shoulder straps have minimal padding, but this pack is small enough that it's not extremely heavy when full.

B00KCXRMKG,5.0,"I received this pack as a review sample and quickly came to the conclusion that these are excellent for noise-free applications. The most critical test was when I used this cable to connect a pair of [[ASIN:B006MA9XXM Brainwavz HM5 Studio Monitor Headphones]] to my stereo. The sound was as neutral and noise free as when I used the high grade cable that came with the phones, so the claim of double shielding hold weight. I would not hesitate to recommend these to audiophiles or sound engineers.<br /><br />In addition to the listening test I thoroughly inspected the physical characteristics. That revealed attention to detail like what appears to be copper cladding or gold plating on the tip, ring and sleeve portions of the connector. The barrel housing is also well constructed and is probably stainless steel. The strain reliefs on the ends are also well done and should protect the ends from internal breakdown even if you frequently handle the cable. The cable itself will stretch to a full twelve feet, but at rest is a little over a foot and a half.<br /><br />What I did not test is the claim that this will fit most phones through their case. That's because the cases that I have on hand will accommodate regular cables. There is a chamfer on the barrel that houses the connector and it looks as though it will fit some of the more finicky iPhone 5 cases, but I cannot guarantee that it will for all cases.<br /><br />These are top quality cables that should last a long time if properly handled and stored. If I do experience a premature failure I'll update this review to reflect that.",positive,positive

It would’ve been perfect if I could attach the extended arm to the highest pole (3rd).  The arm will only clamp to the first and second pole.  I followed the advice of one of the reviewers to put something in the clamp such as a piece of sponge to get it to attach securely.

B07Q7GG2CP,5.0,"Hi,  I am 54 and new technology makes me nervous.  This is my first set of wireless earbuds.  When I first opened the package and saw the enclosed instructions I got even more nervous.  The print is for much younger eyes than mine.  It is very small.  Once I got into the instructions they were very simple.  The book is only big due to the fact that it covers more languages than I could imagine.<br /><br />It is very simple to charge up and get ready.  Pairing them to my iPhone was also very easy.  Switching from music to a phone call just requires a simple tap.<br /><br />I can't compare these to any others since these are my first pair.  I can tell you that these are very easy to use.  They fit me right out of the box.  I did not need to change any of the included pieces for them to fit me.<br /><br />The charging/carrying case is nice.

I also like the intercom skill so we can talk to each other across the house quickly. My one dislike is the tinny sounding small speaker n the Dot. I've grown so accustomed to the balanced, clean sound from the big Echo that the Dot sound quality was a let down with music. However, reading me the news, ordering Starbucks, reading my audio books, working as an alarm clock or intercom is smooth and works just fine.

B09G97XMKR,5.0,"I originally used an FM Bluetooth transmitter but that suddenly got complicated as it kept losing connection. So I returned that and switched to trying this product. This is not an FM transmitter so a radio station is not needed. Just plug it into your aux port, turn your car on and just connect to your phone. The volume and sound quality are far better as it does not rely on an empty FM radio channel. It comes in somewhat charged but I fully charged it anyway. Once fully charged, it does seem to last a long time. I'm not sure how long until it takes to disconnect on its own but keep in mind that it stays connected to your device even when you turn your car off. So, manual power off is ideal when not using. I keep this device plugged to a USB port in my car so it is consistently charged. You can plug this device into just about any non-Bluetooth audio device such as old 1980s speakers/earphones and it will make them Bluetooth compatible.

The headset would also disconnect itself after calls interrupted the audio and the buttons simply wouldn't respond. Tried turning it off and had to plug to charge to have it reset.

The sound is balanced, and I even had to turn the volume down on my computer because they are very efficient (loud).<br /><br />I am not an audiophile, but it sounded perfectly balanced to my ears. The bass isn't boomy, and the mid-range and highs are crystal clear. They sound better than our larger Sonos sound system. In fact, I needed to drown it out because my musical tastes differ widely from my crew.<br /><br />The cord was plenty long, and I was able to comfortably reach the headphone jack from my desktop computer on the floor to my ears without it interfering or forcing me to sit in an awkward position while using them.<br /><br />It came with multiple ear cushions to accommodate smaller ears, and I needed to use one of them for my right ear. I am super impressed with these and still cannot get over the price of these outstanding earbuds. Just buy them, you'll be more than happy!",positive,positive

B09MRSK1WK,5.0,"For the most part I think webcams are pretty interchangeable for the needs of the majority of remote workers. Really all you need is a decent resolution and a microphone that isn't awful.<br />This webcam has 4K resolution the mic has intelligent noise reduction, so that's covered.<br />There are some extras that set this webcam apart from others I have used. The extra wide 120 degree view is very nice, especially when paired with the autoframing feature. This is the most easy, straight from the box device I have used for remote work.<br />Plug it in, and it interfaces seamlessly with Zoom/Teams/Webex/Skype, whatever you use. Everytime I used this I look and sound great, often far better than those on the other side!<br />~~~I hope this REAL review was helpful!~~~",positive,positive
B07YFW5DG6,5.0,Love everything about these headphones! They are well cushioned on the ear pieces which makes them comfortable to wear! The piece on the top of the head is also cushioned for comfort and to prevent hair pulling. It’s great that these are wireless. It’s so easy to pair with your Bluetooth device! They also sound amazing! Noise canceling works well too! They come with a USB plug for charging and a cord if you wish to listen to plugged in instead of wireless. The case is so nice too! Even came with a scented packet inside which smells lovely!! Outstanding quality at an amazing price!,positive,positive
B01HETFPUE,5.0,"These headphones are already getting a workout!  My granddaughter had her heart rate in just minutes out of the box, and, after taking them on a run, she had nothing but good things to say about them.  First, she enjoys the fact that there is nothing on her head - just a wire connection lightly on her neck.  Second, the sound of her favorite music left her almost speechless to describe - clear, sharp - the best sound quality she had ever heard - and to be able to take this with her on a walk or run, was wonderful!  Third, these headphones have turned out to be a motivator - she now looks forward to the exercise, is choosing music suitable for her yoga exercises, etc.  Wow, it's great to see the smile on her face and the difference these headphones have made in her physical activity.  She reminds me that they are also great for  just &quot;chilling out&quot;!  I had hoped to try these out for myself, but it looks like possession is nine tenth of the law!",positive,positive
B089LYXK4M,4.0,"First of all, the signal quality is great over my 300' of CAT5e cable going from my entertainment system in front of my room to my projector around the back (cable goes behind walls and snakes around furnishings to get where it needs to go). It is fast and responsive, and the lag seems minimal if any. I love that it can also be used as a pass through, and that it only requires power on ONE side! My old HDMI extender required a power adapter on both the tx and rx side, but this can actually send power over the network cable (PoE) so that the other side does not need its own adapter. Now THAT's awesome!<br />This is one of the primary reasons I was interested in this, as there are two times I use such an adapter: When I use my projector instead of my TV for movies, and when moving a camera around at an event that I want to send a live feed back to a screen or streaming box for. Currently I have to supply power at both ends of the network cable, but I imagined ONLY needing power on the receiver, and having THAT power the transmitter. For example, in the case of the camera, I could have the screen receiving the signal send power to the transmitter by the camera using PoE and be somewhat more free of tethered power on that side. Also, when using the projector, I could turn on the outlet controlling the projector via remote and have it power on the transmitter behind the TV as well. Less wires and outlet spaces where already difficult / congested is good! THE PROBLEM, however, is that this thing misses its potential by only sending power from the TRANSMITTER! In other words, I can send power from the tx with PoE to the rx side, but the RECEIVER can't power the transmitter! It only goes the same direction as the HDMI signal. This, to me, was disappointing as that's the side I wanted to save from having more wires to plug in. Not the receiving side. That side is never an issue to supply power.<br />So I was a little upset about that. But otherwise, it is a solid product that seems to do what it claims to, and so far seems more reliable than my previous setup. If it could send power using EITHER side, it would be perfect! So close this time!",positive,negative
B00ZRPLR96,5.0,"I received this as a free review sample. Although the Note 4 is not on the list of supported devices my Note 4 came up immediately on my monitor's display, so I can confirm that it works with that phone. It also worked with my Tab Pro 12.2 tablet.<br /><br />This is a quick and inexpensive solution to connecting compatible phones and tablets to monitors and TVs. Frankly I have been using a wireless dongle for that, but this, plus an HDMI switch, has allowed me to access my monitor using my old Note 3 phone as a controller (it's otherwise been sitting around collecting dust since I upgraded to a Note 4.)<br /><br />The cables are thin gauge so I am not sure how much wear and tear they would sustain if you were constantly connecting and disconnecting devices. I have been using this for a week, but the Note 3 to which I am connecting it is relatively stationary.<br /><br />For devices that are supported this is literally plug and go - no drivers, and I did not even have to invoke screen sharing. As soon as I made all of the connections my phone's screen was immediately displayed on the monitor.",positive,negative
B07MLY3JKV,2.0,I thought this was the coolest addition to our Alexa devices... BUT The sound is horrible; it sounds like a busted speaker or a faulty ear piece.

B09D6Y2CFL,4.0,"THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Nice build quality.

This package has no cables. For the price, I feel cables should have been included. I'm going to review another set that's only $10 more yet they provide you with 5 hdmi cables, 4 usb link cables, and a usb physical calculator. It's going to cost more than $10 for you to buy 5 hdmi cables and 4 usb cables. I'll provide a link to this other set once I'm done reviewing it.<br /><br />USE CASE SCENARIO:<br />--------------------------<br />* Why would you need a KVM switch? You can share a single set of keyboard, mouse, speakers for multiple pcs. You can use your same PC monitor to view the Fire Stick, play PS5, Xbox, etc. There is no need to hook up different speakers, as long as you hook up your main speaker to the optical or stereo ports.<br /><br />I will subtract 1-Star for including no cables. A remote is included, but when you use a KVM at the table, your hand just reaches out to press the switch, so a remote is unnecessary. 4-Stars.",positive,negative

B07P6N2R5P,5.0,"I have tested and reviewed many bags and backpacks and this is, by far, the best one I have reviewed this year.<br /><br />There are so many features to love about this pack.<br /><br />First the outer shell is made from super durable polyester fabric that truly is waterproof - not only is it waterproof but the zipper system is as well. I have had this pack in absolute downpours without anything inside getting wet.  The upper carrying handle is reinforced and ergonomically made to fit your hand so lifting and carrying this, even when packed is easy.  The straps on the side are excellent for cinching everything in tight when it’s packed so nothing shifts around.  The shoulder straps have extra thick honeycomb padding as does the panel that rests against the back when carrying, making it not only comfortable but allowing for airflow so you won’t get so hot with it on your back.<br /><br />This packs interior has room to store far more than any other backpack I’ve reviewed for quite a while.  I’m able to fit my 17” laptop in that section with ease along with all of the necessary accessories.  In addition to that there is another heavily padded area where I store my iPad.  These areas completely open to lay flat  - perfect for TSA screening.<br /><br />As with the majority of modern backpacks there is an external charging port (as is typical, the external power supply is not included) and there is a perfect location for holding your power supply.  There is a port for leading headphone wires from the interior out.<br /><br />I have put this pack to all sorts of real life tests over the last couple of months and it has continually impressed me with its outstanding performance. This has become my go to bag and I most definitely recommend this one.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.  I enjoy writing them as I value reading other’s reviews when I’m making a buying decision.  I regularly update my reviews to reflect any changes I may discover and to include helpful tips you may need if you purchase the product.  I will always make every effort to answer any questions I can as it is my pleasure to help.",positive,positive

B00MRGKPH8,5.0,"Like most of the other reviewers I received this as a review sample along with a [[ASIN:B00N38TQJC Sabrent Premium 4 Port Aluminum USB 3.0 Hub]]. This will actually work with just about any of Sabrent's hubs as well as most other 5 volt (DC) devices on the market that require up to 4 Amps of current.<br /><br />The barrel connector comes with an adapter to a larger size barrel connector to cover Sabrent hubs. I have checked every source I could find to get the barrel connector specs, but none are to be found. This is frustrating to say the least because this is truly a multi-purpose power supply that can be used on non-Sabrent products. Since it is not claimed to be universal I am giving it five stars because it works perfectly with the hub with which I tested it.<br /><br />One feature that I particularly like is the fact that the cable is heavy duty with good strain reliefs on both ends. This is not your typical, flimsy power supply cable. Another thing I like is this runs cool even with constant use. I am using it to power a hub with a disk drive and both the hub and this power supply are running cool even after a twenty-four hour period.<br /><br />This is capable of providing up to four Amps, but will only 'push' what the device requires. What that means is if you are powering four devices that draw .6 Amps each this supply will only push 2.4 Amps, so there is no worry about overloading. On the other hand if you are attempting to power a hum that requires over 4 Amps this is not the proper power supply and will not work.<br /><br />If you own a Sabrent powered hub this is a safe choice, Do make sure you know the total current draw of the devices into the hub and make sure that the total does not exceed four Amps.",positive,negative
B07TSBX3KF,4.0,"[[VIDEOID:aedbd047bdcee111326af43f1b70c93c]] After experimenting with several small speakers to use with my Echo Dot, I became enamored with the Doss Soundbox Touch because it had the best overall sound quality compared to other speakers in its price range. Naturally, I couldn't wait to try the Doss Touch Plus when it came up for review.<br /><br />It is larger than my original Doss Soundbox, and I was expecting the same well rounded dynamic range with a little more volume. This speaker paired effortlessly with all of my devices.<br /><br />The touch controls are my favorite. It not only gives this speaker a sleek modern look, but they also make it a breeze to change functions effortlessly. It's like swiping my phone screen between apps and I have become spoiled by not having to push or press anything. It sounds like a small thing, but once you live with it you will find anything that that requires more effort to be an inconvenience.<br /><br />The Soundbox Plus boasts an increased battery life when using it without the light feature. The light show is fun, but it's not a big draw for me since I use this near my computer monitor and it's somewhat distracting.<br /><br />The sound quality is decent, but it is not what I had expected. It has larger drivers and moves more air, so there is increased volume but the sound quality degrades and becomes too bright. I hear mostly the mid and high ranges with slightly muddled bass. However, at a lower volume, the sound quality improves and becomes more balanced. I love the touch control features, and it's attractive enough for use in every room.<br /><br />As a side note, Doss customer service is second to none. The best I have ever experienced outside of Amazon's support team.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

B09W8W56TM,3.0,"Ok, to be fair I work with cameras for a living. I wasn't expecting this to compete with my cinema cameras or even popular DSLRs for video, but I was expecting it to at least hold up to the standards people are expecting from cell phone cameras these days. It doesn't. Aside from filling a 4K frame, there aren't a lot of positives to say about the video quality.<br />To be fair, this has a LOT of advantages over using a cell phone. Recording for long lengths of time onto an SD card is a big plus, not the mention the ability to mount it to a standard tripod and have accessories like a mic and light attached to the body (which are all included!). It comes with a wide angle lens (that is oddly called ""macro"", but no- it's not for macro shots, its for going wider) which screws on to the front, as well as a handle mounting bracket, an LED light and a microphone. It even comes with a 64GB card, a spare battery, and not one but TWO useful carrying cases (a large one for everything, and a smaller one for just the camera solo). But that's about all the positives I can say about it. If you are outside with a lot of light, you can get decent shots, but this isn't a zoom lens, the zoom is digital only. You can go wide with the external lens or just stay at a fixed medium without it. So no closeup shots for soccer moms. The dynamic range when using it indoors was pretty bad, worse than your average mid-range cell phone. Forget about low light. But that's ok, because the ergonomics of a camera make it better than a cell phone, right?<br />Well, sorta. Holding it with the strap and the flip out screen is nice. But the UI is confusing, it's hard to go back and watch clips you took because everything is kind of sluggish and not intuitive- once we went past the first page of recorded clips, it was really difficult to move to the next page without accidentally clicking and opening a clip for playback. It just feels really laggy to navigate. Then there's the mic input... it's actually a proprietary plug that goes into the charging/USB plug, and gives you a pigtail for USB on one side and a mic input jack on the other. Odd, considering it COMES with a mic, you'd think it would have an input directly on the body. But no, just this weird mess of wires. Everything about this feels like jumping through a hoop to make it do what you want, and at the end of the day you have to wonder if you couldn't just be better off getting a mic adapter for the cellphone you already own and putting it in one of those holster cages.<br />Speaking of cell phones, this does have an app which supposedly lets you remotely control and perhaps even copy files from it, but I didn't get that far. I tried to install the app but then gave up when I decided I didn't want to grant this all the permissions it wanted from my personal phone. And I didn't think the video quality was worth it either.<br />Oddly enough, I kind of like the accessories it comes with. The LED light is pretty nice, the mic isn't terrible either. But for the money, I feel like I would have rather skipped those accessories and just gotten a better camera for a little bit more. It feels almost like they realized this camera was a hard sell so they beefed it up with lots of a accessories for the price.<br />In conclusion, you DO get a lot of accessories for the money. It's not the worst camera I've ever used, and you can't really get a set with everything you need for any less so I'd say it's worth at least 3 stars for being a functional kit. But I can't really imagine a scenario that I would recommend it.",positive,negative
B07GVLKZRM,5.0,I am impressed with this little speaker. It has good sound for the size. Took me a little to figure out the pairing with my phone.

B003EM8008,4.0,"Great value for the money.  The buds go right up behind your tragus really blocking any extra sound.  For those of us with a tragus piercing, it does work fine, but my earring starts to ache after maybe 45 minutes.  But it does not slip out even with the tragus stud.  The wire seemed like poorer quality than I was anticipating--thicker and flat rather than thin and roundish like the more current models--but that is more of a style critique than one of functionality.  The headphones have worked well for the few weeks that I have been using it.  If you're looking for something that will stay in your ear and block out all other sound, producing high sound quality, this is a great model to get, especially for the price.",positive,negative
B00HRO3IBA,4.0,"I purchased a MacBook Pro a few months ago and love the laptop computer.  I've been an Apple customer since the inception of Macintosh, owning only one PC in my lifetime. I have never purchased an iPad.  The [[ASIN:B00HRO3IBA Toshiba Chromebook CB35-A3120 PLM01U-002005 13.3-Inch Cloud Computer]] is Toshiba's first entry into the Chromebook market, my first Chromebook and it did not disappoint this consumer.<br /><br />It is about the same dimensions as my MacBook Pro, but thinner and substantially lighter in weight.  With a solid state, no hard drive or DVD in this one, it is the one I'll take when traveling.  Out of the box, I plugged in the Chromebook, then opened the lid.  Immediately, the registration process began and since I'm already a Google customer, it was quick and simple.  Setup was faster than fast and within a couple of minutes I was on the web, with access to all my Google contents, even those from my Android.  Another few minutes and I was set up to print from my Epson printer which is in another room.  Whereas I need to use an Epson app to print from the Android, this prints from the Google Cloud.  The Google store offers a lot of apps, many of which are free, and a few which I found desirable and downloaded.  With two USB ports, I'm able to carry a USB with me instead of relying on the cloud for everything.  With the HDMI, I can hook up to a larger screen if I want.  Chromebooks are designed for streaming and internet based operations, and there is no software to install.  It's all out there for you to use without taking up space or requiring moving parts in your computer.  Microsoft Office doesn't work, but documents can be put into Google Docs, then be converted to an Office document.<br /><br />The appearance of this Chromebook is very sleek, with an attractive texture to the cover that feels good in the hand.  For me, it's an easier, less slippery grip than others I've held onto.  Start up is nearly instantaneous with the Chromebook as soon as the lid is lifted up -- I turn it off each time I'm done with it.  The battery time is longer than I'd expected, fortunately because although the charge time is fast, the power supply I have gets uncomfortably hot.  Because of this, I do not keep it plugged in while charging.  My second criticism of this unit is that it makes a disturbing noise on the left side closest to me periodically while operating.  At first, I thought the sound was coming from the power supply, but determined it is from the Chromebook after disconnecting the power supply.  It's not constant, just annoying when it occurs because it takes over my focus.  The keypad is very comfortable for me and I've not stumbled moving between my MacBook Pro and Toshiba Chromebook.  The trackpad is a little jumpy, but not as bad as it could be, even after making adjustments through the Settings.  The screen presents a terrific image and the speakers also are better than I'd expected at this price.  All in all, I can't believe they are selling this Chromebook for 279.  I can see why Chromebooks are all that in schools now.  It's nice to have an option to lock your Chromebook if you're taking it to a place where it might ""walk away"" and requiring a sign-in to access the operating system is another plus.  I like it and could love the Toshiba Chromebook in time.<br /><br />UPDATE a few days later:  Amazonian Consumer, another customer, provided comments on my review which I think are important.  He/she noted things that are posted on the Toshiba website, so I'll address the components.  I have used the Bluetooth with no problem at all.  The RAM is limited to what's installed and the battery is not user-replaceable.  There is a Skype limitation because Chrome OS uses Hangouts instead, and the camera does work fine.  The SD card reader works, too, without a problem.  I also didn't mention that I like the Velcro cable wrap attached to the power cord, so I don't have to add one.  Mine power supply still gets hot, but when the charge is complete, it cools down.  Ironically, my Chromebook has stopped making the noises it was initially making.  Another observation I've made is that the trackpad seems to occasionally have a mind of its own and it sends things before I'm ready.  It's more than being overly sensitive and I'm going to need to work on correcting this.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/6/14: The audio now continuously goes in and out and the machine sound which I mentioned in my initial review is occurring again, usually when the audio goes out.  I have a call in to Toshiba but they aren't trained yet to deal with the Chromebook, so someone will be calling me back ""in a day or two.""  I'm also still experiencing the cursor arbitrarily moving up on the page when I have stopped typing, so I have to be especially careful to assure that what I'm typing is being entered where intended.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/18/14: The audio problem is even worse and Toshiba never called me or net an email other than a survey on their customer service.  It took several of my initiated attempts in phone calls and I'm finally awaiting a box and label which will take another two days to arrive for this Chromebook to be returned to Toshiba for repair.  They offered me no option of simply sending a label and letting me return it in the original boxes.  Dealing with them has been terrible and one rep had the gall to ask if I'd rate him a 10 on a scale of 1-10 for assistance in a survey.<br /><br />I'm tempted to reduce my rating of four stars but will hold off until I receive my repaired lemon of a Chromebook which I still love despite its clicking sound, faulty speakers, sticky trackpad and terrible Toshiba telephone customer service.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/11/14:  Received my repaired Chromebook last night (FedEx signature required delivery was only option) and the speakers had been replaced.  What a difference!  No clicking sound, humming, anything other than the sound of lovely audio through the speakers.  The trackpad still isn't the smoothest, but more importantly, it still selects things that I have no intention of selecting.  For example, when selecting an email, one above or below opens instead of the one I select.  I've also had pages close or disappear for no apparent reason.",positive,positive

It's great to be able to sit here and have music and movies sound right. The only time I had a problem with these was walking around. They didn't stay in place once I started sweating.

B01IPJX8W4,4.0,"I knew, due to my disability, that I was going to need to find a professional installer to install this Boss Audio Systems B9351WRC head unit and wireless reverse camera along with two replacement door speakers I decided needed replacement (and wow, they really needed replacing). The installation took approximately three hours or so. The only problem which may not be a problem but I'm a worrier. The bracket for the wireless reverse camera somewhat, but not entirely, covers the plate expiration stickers somewhat. Other than that the head unit fit as good if not better than the stock radio fit. in the dashboard.<br />This radio plays AM/FM stations though there's very few decent radio stations around here. The unit also plays from USB thumb drives which plugs into a port under a panel under the volume/pause/power button. I put 600+ songs on a USB 2.0 16 GB driver and it played everything as far as I could tell. There might be a couple VBR or odd format MP3 files it may not play but I haven't gotten to them yes. Nothing's refused to play and even a couple that had imbedded album artwork actually showed up but so small it was almost impossible to see and I had no idea how to make it better. The instructions in the manual were basically &#34;Play with things and see what happens!&#34; more than  specific directions how different functions work.<br />What I went with, is a 32 gig micro-SD card that had the same 600+ songs the thumb drive has. But with the micro-SD card you can close the hatch under the volume and control knob which you couldn't with the thumb drive. There's also an AUX input jack for old style MP3 players and phones.<br />The six inch screen is sharp and crisp. The backup camera, even with a streetlight thirty feet away had more than enough light to back out of my garage. I even backed down the street a ways in almost complete darkness and could see just fine with just the reverse lights on the car. Now as long as no cops have a problem with it I'm golden.<br />I tried home burned CDs and while it took a few seconds longer to recognize it played them fine. I tried store bought CDs and they played right off the bat. OH! and it plays DVD discs jut fine in case my passenger wants to watch a movie as we drive. I promise I'm no dumb enough to watch a movie while I drive.<br />According to the installer I can leave the micro SD card in the unit all the time. So, 600+ songs anytime I want which I can shuffle or randomly pick and play songs anytime I want. I couldn't be happier. With the stock deck I'd sometimes get to my destination just as the deck decided to recognize the CD so this deck is a godsend when I really needed a new one. Now with as many songs as I can cram into a 32 gig drive. Right now I've got 687 songs and tons of free space. I may have to start buying more music and ripping some more albums from my collection to add to my micro-SD card.<br />So I can play hundreds, thousands of MP3 songs on a micro-SD card. I can play CDs both homemade and store bought. I can watch DVDs on a pretty sharp (all settings can be changed in the system) the dimmer is a bit bright until it goes off completely but it's not too bad or too bright. There's a user setting EQ option as well as several other preset settings to choose from. There are options to add sound effects such as large hall, church, cavern, etc. I avoided them entirely and set my own EQ settings with the loudness off. The new speakers sound great for high end and midrange. The stock back speakers add some needed bass.<br />All in all? This is an affordable head unit with all the features and functions one could ask for. It comes with a remote that I'm not sure I'm even going to keep anywhere in the car. Anything you need to do can be done on the deck and no one's sitting in the back seat of a '07 Hyundai Accent, seriously. So the remote is useless but amusing.<br />I love this unit, the backup cam is awesome, The many ways to play music. The fit and finish, it's close to perfect.<br />This a little long and meandering review but I really like this radio and I'm glad I replaced the door speakers and went with a professional installer who's basically given me a lifetime warranty on his labor. I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />Update 04-04-2017: It's been nearly six months since I had this head unit and backup camera installed. Radio reception is still bad, I still despise listening to radio so that's no big deal. Have kept a micro SD card loaded with hundreds of songs installed. Turn the unit on it automatically defaults to that. Everything is  still working fine. Professional installation was worth the money.",positive,negative

B07F46R5XT,3.0,"If you're looking to buy this radio probably the radio you want is the Eton Field. Yes it's 50% more in price but more than 50% in value.

It's lighter and the plastic is thinner than the Eton, and the knobs are cheaper.<br /><br />The reception and sound quality of the Eton Field is why I'm sending this back.  It sounds better on easy stations,  and it gets a hard to get FM station at the very edge of the dial locally that the CCrane EP Pro can't hear at all. It's a rave station I like.  Plus my usual oldies stations which can be hard to get are received better on the Eton.

B001GUVYGC,2.0,"While I finally got it to work, doing so was not remotely intuitive.  But if you just bought one and wondering what you need to do, here is how this one works:<br /><br />You have to use the little plastic or small flat screw driver to put each wire in the lid, not the metal prongs.  And when I say put them in the lid, I mean ALL the way down, they each pass a certain point when you get a feed back as your are pushing down that they are now firmly in.  When done, double make sure they are all as far flat against the lid as possible (otherwise they'll align with the wrong metal prong).<br /><br />Now close the lid and use pliers or something to REALLY clamp it down.  After I removed the cable's built in jack and added this, my speed dropped from 1gb to 100, but after I grabbed a small rubber band TIGHTLY wrapped it around the lid/body, the speed is back up to 1gb.<br /><br />So definitely not the best product, but I have nothing to compare it to since this was the first time I had done this.",negative,negative

B00IUICOR6,4.0,"For some purchasing this pair of BOSE SoundTrue headphones would be quite the investment.  The question then becomes ""are these headphones worth the money?"" Over the last two years or so, I have purchased several headphones as gifts. My sons (both teens) had been begging for headphones, specifically the Beats by Dre, for some time.  So began my research on headphones on the market. I wanted a quality product for a reasonable price. So when Amazon offered a special on the V-Moda headsets, during the holidays two years ago, I couldn't pass up the deal. I purchased two pair and was pleased. Both of my sons loved them, especially when they compared them to their friends ""Beats"". The V-Modas were sturdy and not as bass heavy as the Beats. The bass of the V-Moda wasn't amplified and overwhelming. They didn't feel that they were sacrificing sound quality or style. During this same time period, my husband purchased two sets of Sennheiser (PX 100 and 250 series), one for himself and another as a Christmas gift. One set was around the ear and the other, over the ear. So, over a two year time span, I have had the opportunity to listen to music with all of these headphones and can offer an opinion. And while I am not an expert, I am an average wife and mother who intends to use these headphones for recreational purposes (i.e., when cleaning the house, walking in the neighborhood, etc) only.<br /><br />These headphones are:<br /><br />1.  Extremely light weight. Light enough to put in a purse, book-bag or briefcase, etc. without weighing you down.<br />2.  Comfortable. The ear-covers and headband are padded and extremely comfortable when worn. They block out most if not all of the outside noise. Your ears are completely covered and the sound is crystal clear. **While the ears of the set remain secure or in place, I did notice that the headphone would fall down occasionally. To correct this, I would suggest that you adjust the headphones tighter than you normally would, especially if you have thick hair and this seems to correct the problem.<br />3.  Functional. There is a long cord that attaches from your device to the headset. The long cord gives you some flexibility and mobility. But caution, you may want to secure some of the cord if you are using an armband type holder for your device. Otherwise the cord might get stuck on stuff while you are using it. You can operate various functions (volume, etc) from the back of the microphone. It is located on the cord near your mouth. However, I do wish that the microphone with the function button was lower on the cord, or could be adjusted because while it is comfortable when using the microphone, it isn't when you adjust the sound. If it was further down, you could adjust the sound easier and see the buttons clearly.<br />4.  Can be used with multiple devices. I use mine with my IPOD, IPAD, computer and Android phone (Nexus 4, Google Phone).<br />5.  Enclosed in a convenient carrying case. It fits well in most bags or luggage. They are easy to pack up and travel with.<br />6.  Sound quality. While not bass heavy at all, I think these are perfect for all kinds of music. My playlist includes music from artists like Mree, Daley, Jhene Aiko, The Weekend, Diana Krall, Young Summer and Cary Brothers...and the sound is great.  These headphones have a nice, kind of surround sound quality.  These definitely complement all music types. But if you want deep bass, I wouldn't recommend these. But if you want clear sound, these are the headphones for you.<br />7. Kind of Expensive. These headphones cost about $180. And while that price is comparable to others (i.e., The V-Modas are around $200 and the Beats can range from $200 to $300.) on the market, are you getting the same features for the price? Probably. However, if you are a DJ or money is no object, you may not blink at the price, hence viewing it as an investment. But for the average consumer, you have to consider the features and decide if they are worth the money. So if you aren't looking for bass heavy or exaggerated sound, and you like the fact that these completely cover the entire ear, these are the perfect headphones for you. I give them 4 stars.",positive,positive

Now, I had to subtract a star because although this speaker jams, the bass wasn't quite there enough for me.

B00LGQ6HL8,5.0,"Normally when I receive a review sample I can do a thorough evaluation and write a review within two days. This one took longer. The reason is that it took me a while to hear the differences in this model versus the [[ASIN:B00G4UQ6U8 Brainwavz S1 In Ear Headphones]], which also impressed me (and I also own).<br /><br />After going through a pile of albums to try to understand what the product description meant by smoother bass I finally found an album that allowed me to hear it: [[ASIN:B00492ANTS Portrait In Jazz]]. When Scott LaFaro's bass came in on Autumn Leaves I started switching back and forth between this and the S1, and also hauled out some studio reference monitors. These phones are capable of going down in the 18Hz range for the low end, which is lower than most in ear monitors and phones that are usually in the 20Hz range at the low end. I am not sure my ears can discretely detect the differences between 18 and 20, but I was able to detect nuances that the lower end provided.<br /><br />These also go up a little higher than more phones, which are usually in the 20 KHz range, Again, I am not sure I can truly hear sounds at 24KHz, but there is a discernible difference. I tested that end of the frequency spectrum with a few Ahmad Jamal albums since he tended towards the right side of his pianos.<br /><br />One other thing that took me some getting accustomed to was the over-the-ear way of wearing these. I am use to in-ear or the old fashioned over-the-hear phones and I had to play around with these before I figured out how to place them in my ears perfectly. If you are use to over-the-ear you will probably not experience the learning curve that I did.<br /><br />A few other features that I have come to expect from this brand are here: extra tips of different sizes, a hard case ([[ASIN:B00HPPL1M4 Brainwavz Hard Earphone Case]]) and a 1/4"" adapter. I love the flat, tangle-free cable that is tougher than it feels. And it has an adjuster like a chin strap on a cowboy hat that aids in keeping these firmly in place with the over-the-ear way of wearing them.<br /><br />This is definitely a five star set of phones (according to my way of grading, anyway), and one that I will not hesitate to recommend to fellow musicians. We tend to spend a great deal of time listening to music and these do an excellent job of reproducing it. My advice, though, is to take your time when you first get them because their true power is not immediately apparent. When you do start hearing the difference you will understand why I rated them so highly.",positive,negative

B0186SDYZU,5.0,"[[VIDEOID:90e56caf53bb9127a941c450bd417db8]] A battery-powered radio receiver is a good piece of equipment to have on hand when there is an emergency. It can be used to receive important information when there is no power otherwise available. This particular receiver works well and it has the distinction of being one of the smallest receivers I have ever used. It is about the size of a cell phone and it is able to receive shortwave signals as well as AM & FM stations.<br /><br />This unit is small enough to fit in a pocket and is comparable in size to my iPhone 6 in its case. This makes it ideal for packing along on a trip or keeping someplace where it can be out of the way but ready in an emergency. In my opinion, the size is one of the strongest selling points.<br /><br />Turning it on by the switch does not turn on receiving. This turns on only the power to the LCD and from there the radio can be turned on by holding down the on/off button on the front. This is an interesting way to make sure the radio is not accidentally powered on, though it is slightly inconvenient. This feature suggests the ideal behind this radio is primarily emergency readiness.<br /><br />There are a number of ranges set for AM, FM and shortwave on this radio that correspond to different locales. Operable range in one country may be very different than in another, and by separating these out into preset ranges enables changing the suitability for a locale a matter of pressing a button rather than tracking down a new device. This makes traveling with this radio very workable.<br /><br />After turning it on I have had no issue with finding stations on each appropriate frequency range, though it was easiest finding FM stations due to the prevalence of such in the area where I live.<br /><br />This is an interesting little radio. It works well, and it is able to pick up stations in different regions by simply changing the available range to scan. The size makes it easy to take with you. Though it is most clearly useful as an emergency radio it works well as a general purpose radio too.

B003PPGOC0,5.0,"I purchased this for two specific reasons: (1) safety because too many accidents are caused by drivers with a phone to their ear, and (2) I love music and my Droid X has become my MP3 player (among other things as well as a phone.<br /><br />Installation was a snap, although I did have to read the directions, which were clear and easy to follow. In less than 5 minutes after removing it from the packaging I was listening to music through my car radio!<br /><br />This device comes with a fairly short USB charging cable that connects to a port on the head. The length made it inconvenient, and it was pretty flimsy too, failing after about three months. I added a [[ASIN:B0042X8XQO PowerLine 90310 Auto Socket Splitter with USB Power Port]] (which cleared my console in my 2008 Mazda 3 with the GOgroove and [[ASIN:B000S5Q9CA Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate Charger]] plugged in), and the combination, while unwieldy, has worked perfectly ever since.<br /><br />Music and calls are reasonably clear. I do have to turn my radio volume up when a call comes in, but that may be an issue with my phone and not the GOgroove. And, like a hands-free system should work, when there is an incoming call or you wish to make an outgoing one, the MP3 player feature in my Droid X pauses the music until I am finished using the phone. After calls are terminated any paused music will automatically resume.<br /><br />For long trips where you pass through areas with radio stations, your clear signal set in one location may start to degrade and you will notice static. That is caused by you coming into the range of a strong FM signal that is competing with the one you selected. You will need to seek and switch to a new frequency when that happens. For example, if I am traveling from, say, Ormond Beach, FL to Jacksonville, FL, I will need to change my frequency twice going up and twice again returning. It's the nature of any such device and there is nothing that can be designed into the GOgroove to fix it - at least not at the price point at which this device is selling.<br /><br />I've had friends connect to it with their iPhones, and it works without a hitch. The icing on the cake is the GOgroove remains paired with my Droid X, and automatically connects to it as soon as I start my car if I am playing music. This is a convenient feature that I wish my [[ASIN:B0047T79VS Belkin F8Z492TTP Bluetooth Music Receiver]] that is connected to my home stereo had - I have to manually connect to that device anytime I want to use it.<br /><br />Overall I am thrilled with my GOgroove and if it dies I would not hesitate to purchase another. In fact, I am considering purchasing a spare anyway because I spend a lot of time in my car and life without this wonderful gizmo would not be the same.",positive,negative
B07Q5DWKRC,5.0,"I ordered this Oviitech Surge Protector Power Strip Tower 5 AC Outlets with 3 USB Charging Ports(3.1A Total), 4 Feet Cord Wire Extension, White and Gray, ETL Listed to review.  Having multiple Power strips that lay flat, I was curious to see how this would measure up.  My thoughts are below:<br />• This standing power strip is well made.<br />• It feels durable and the cord is thick and well protected in rubber.<br />• The cord works well on our crafting table, as it has 5 plug in outlets and 3 USB ports.  We can have multiple items such as a sewing machine, heat press, die cut machine, magnifying lamp, etc all plugged in it at the same.  Not to mention you can charge your phone also at the same time.<br />• It makes it so much easier to unplug and plug in your electronics as you do not have to crawl under your desk or table to find the outlet or fat laying power strip.<br />• Because you can plug the cord in behind your desk/table, there is not a tripping hazard as with some extension power strips.<br />• The distance between the outlets is wide enough that you can actually fit three plugs on one side and two on the other.  So many times, power strips are made with outlets that are too close together so you only get half use out of them.<br />• The base is sturdy, and it sits flat on the table/desk.  Does not easily tip over.<br />• It has worked exactly as it is described.<br />• The quality is worth the price point.  Probably exceeds it.<br />Overall, this is well made functional standing tower power strip.  Well worth it’s cost.  We will most likely be buying another for our den/office.",positive,positive
B01CEAYWZW,4.0,"This sucker is strong, no doubt, but my phone is heavy. I have an S5 with an Anker battery case, and the stand, while strong enough to withhold the phone up, cannot grip the magnet as well, as such, the phone does slide down during my car ride, so I have to keep readjusting.<br /><br />That said, the actual features are fine, even if the speaker on my phone isn't the best (seriously, who thought having the speaker on the rear of the phone was a good idea?). You may find that many of the reviews for the app say it's not great, but be aware that the app requires either this stand or Logitech's ventilator mount to operate. With either of those, you'll be good to hear all the features.<br />I tend to use the car radio more for music, so the lack of musical options on the app isn't a downer. What makes it indispensable for me is the heavy-duty stand to use Waze and to pick up or send the occasional call. Thus far, after a week of using, I've not had any issues with the phone.<br /><br />The suction works fine, even if the dashboard isn't perfectly flat. It grips on without any wobble.",positive,positive

B07Q4QK379,5.0,"I've been using these headphones for a week and I can't get over the superior sound quality. They feature terrific high end frequency replication and offer a bass you can feel. I experimented briefly with the Bose music app, but I have enough apps on my phone already and this connects fine as a regular Bluetooth device. In the end, the comfort and sound quality are the most important and not the other features. Both are great on this product.<br /><br />These headphones have a really nice, sleek design. The ear cups swivel and can be easily adjusted to fit your head. The ear cups have what seems to be a soft leather or imitation leather padding that is comfortable and helps create a seal that blocks out external noise. You can adjust the amount of noise cancellation, so these are ideal headphones for both travel and zoning out.<br /><br />The headphones charge with a USB-C charging port. At this time most of my other devices require a USB Micro-B, but I'm seeing more of he C ports and cables. A charging cable is included along with an AUX cable. You also get a very nice plastic hard case that zips closed.<br /><br />The headphones have a minimal design with only three buttons. The only button that's labeled is the Bluetooth button. One really cool feature is that the front half of the right ear cup can recognize taps and gestures. Instead of feeling around for a tiny button, you can just double tap the ear cup to play your music or answer a call. You can adjust volume by swiping down or swiping up. The 20 hour battery life means these are always ready to play.<br /><br />I'm sure this set of headphones has more features than I'll ever use. The most important thing is that they are very comfortable, easily adjustable, and sound terrific. If you love music on the go, these headphones are a perfect choice.",positive,positive
B07DW4NWQB,5.0,"These headphones are easy to operate, do a good job cancelling noise in the room from televisions, kids, dogs and husbands. They are also comfortable. They were so simple to set up.

Put on one of my songs and I had to turn the volume  down quite a bit. They get plenty loud. I am very impressed with these headphones. I may be swapping out the ones I use nightly for these.",positive,positive
B00012O6QQ,3.0,"Although it's a great price on Amazon, I'd spend the extra $40 and get yourself a decent car stereo.<br /><br />I installed this in my 2000 Toyota 4Runner with stock speakers and a 10&#34; Kicker sub/200w amp.  Althought it does the job, it doesn't do it with any real impact.  It creates sound, and it functions, but don't expect amazing sound.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment was the bluetooth performance.  Although it's got all the phone gadgets, and includes a microphone, the connection with both my Android, iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 were all fuzzy.  Yup - the louder you pumped the volume the louder the bluetooth fuzz was!  It was really distracting, almost like using a tape deck aux converter.  It's just poor quality.<br /><br />I used it for about 8 months, but finally gave in and purchased a decent Pioneer unit that has crystal clear bluetooth connectivity, and much better control over stock speaker sound.<br /><br />Just spend the extra money.

B08R7WLBG7,4.0,"The Skagen Men's Hybrid HR Jorn Smartwatch is an elegant watch first and smart watch second.  It is considered a hybrid because it is a watch first.  Even with almost no battery life left, it still serves as a traditional watch with a stylish, all metal body and actual watch hands with glow-in-the-dark inserts for visibility without a front-light.  In terms of thickness, unfortunately, this watch isn't any thinner than other Android Wear watches I've used.<br /><br />For the ""smart"" portion of the watch, the Skagen is equipped with an e-ink display, which means that once the watch face is drawn, no more power is drawn from the battery to keep that display.  This means that the watch will last much longer than a regular, oled-display smart watch.  It is easy to tell that this e-ink display is of high quality because it does not have the yellow hue that older e-ink displays had.  It is quite similar in quality to the paper-white kindle.<br /><br />Beyond the screen is the software.  The Skagen watch pares down the smart functionalities to only what a user may actually need on a watch.  No games, no maps, no speakerphone functionality.  Instead, the watch will track your workouts, show you notifications, and control your music player.  It really is everything I normally do on my Android Wear watch.  There are many watch faces, and multiple complications for customization.  One can even use a photo as the background for the watch face.  I did find that any watch faces with numbers tend to crowd out the UI and there is very little room for complications.<br /><br />For all of this, Skagen priced this watch about $100 less than other smart watches so it really is a good option for those who just want a wearable that gives them the essentials.",positive,positive

B09J8H9SQD,3.0,These caught my attention because of the cool led inside the charging case. Practical use though they kind of fell short. The sound wasn’t at all what I had hoped. I just needed enough volume to drown out the gyms sound system. But even outside without music blaring it was still oddly hard to hear. The ear hooks were a little too weak for my liking. I prefer something a bit more ridged since I’m using these as gym headphones. Over these weren’t terrible they were just ok. For my use (gym sessions) it didn’t quite fit the bill. But I think if you need a pair to have laying around as a backup these are priced right and a decent choice.,positive,positive

This is now our new beach and pool side system.  The charge last about 20 hours at 60% volume.  One charge will last all day at max volume.  Easy to charge and connect.

The best free app that virtually has no ads is USB CAMERA VIEWER by Homesoft, LLC. This is the app you see in my video demo.

However, I love this thing for travel so I can back my pics up when I'm away from my computer.  Only gripe is having to take the case off. If they had made both sides of the reader the same it would fit. But one side of the connector is slightly shorter than the other and it's just enough to keep it from seating.

I always worry about these wireless headphones because I tend to be terrible at keeping them in one place, and these are quite pricey so losing one would really be unfortunate. They come with a really nice carrying case, it's a super durable case, thankfully, and I really like that it's easy to put the headphones in it (just drop it in and like a magnet kind of pulls them down). It's super easy to charge, and I really like that when I start using them a little voice comes on and tells me how much battery life is left. The battery life is also pretty impressive, I used them for hours upon hours without the battery running out, so I was pretty impressed by that.<br />The sound quality on these is amazing.

B06Y11B6L8,5.0,"It is harder and harder to find any radio that has an AM radio band on it, let alone a really good one.  It is also rather difficult to find a decent radio that is not digitally tuned and controlled.  This radio is a good solid radio with both of the above features on it.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS RADIO LIKE?<br />This radio is a good solid radio.  It has a slide switch under the tuning bar which has three settings - OFF, AM, and FM.  On the right side are two dials.  There is one with volume that goes from Minimum to Maximum.  The other dial is the tuning dial.  That makes the tuning bar slide up and down for both AM and FM.  There is a handle on top that flips up or goes down.  There is a pull out telescopic antenna on the top for better reception.  There is a place in the left side where you plug in the electric cord, but you can remove it if you prefer to operate solely by batteries.  The cord is a little over 5 feet long.  The plug is a two pronged plug and is polarized.  There is a door on the back which slides off and allows you to put in 3 AA batteries.  The door has attached hinges so you don't have to worry about losing the battery door off of the unit unless it breaks.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS RADIO PERFORM?<br />For AM I would say that it has okay reception  It is not WOW but it is not terrible either.  Since AM is not really dominating the airwaves anymore, I imagine that some people would not find this to be a problem. If you want really strong AM reception, this is okay, but you might be able to find better.<br /><br />For FM reception, the radio is great.  It pulls in quite a few stations and also plays them very clearly.  The speaker is best showcased by FM.  It is a full sound and impressive considering the size of the speaker and the basic nature of the radio.  I found that it is a nice sound and enjoyable.<br /><br />HANDLE<br />The handle has a bit of a recoil to help it snap back into place, but it does seem just a little bit flimsy to me.  I wish it was just a bit sturdier.  It is not enough to take off a star.<br /><br />WHAT WOULD THIS RADIO COME IN HANDY FOR?<br />For those of you who are from the era where radios of this nature were commonplace, I am not writing this comment section for you.  You already know what this would be good for.  For those of you who think that In Tune, or other internet radio stations would suffice for any AM or FM radio stations, I would like to mention that during weather crises, that AM/FM and shortwave radio tend to be the only reception you can get if any.  That includes disasters.  At that point, internet is not an option, so it is important to have a back up communication capability to keep up on what is going on and any emergency information that might come up, or even information about upcoming help.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This radio is handy.  It is a decent size, sturdy, and a solid basic radio.  It gets decent reception and has a nice speaker which is especially nice for FM.  During emergencies and times of crises, this is a good backup to have should internet not be an option.  Running on both electricity and AA batteries, this would be a great addition to your basic emergency kit.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Despite the handle being a bit flimsier than I would like, it is still decent and a solid radio.  I do not think that it is worth taking off a star.",positive,positive

As soon as you take it out of the box you question the quality of the product. It feels light and made of cheap plastic. But as long as it performs it's good right?<br /><br />Well let's start with the positives. The sound quality is excellent. Not too bass-y which is what I like. It is clear and the sound separation is quite nice. I noticed instruments in some songs which I haven't heard in my previous wireless earbuds. All in all this is a great sounding earbuds. You can also use it mono or one at a time.<br /><br />But that is where the qualities end. The ANC is bare minimum. There's no app support.

But I dont know if it's my product or in general, the mic only seems to work properly on the right earbud. The left earbud barely picks up my voice.<br /><br />The main issue I had with this earbud is the Bluetooth connectivity. It would disconnect randomly in the middle of calls. One time it kept disconnecting and reconnecting a few times in the same call. When listening to something the track sometimes skip randomly. And there is no clear indication or it doesn't let you know that it's low on battery. It just dies when the buds run out of juice.<br /><br />The battery life is average.

B08LL622ZR,4.0,"This usb type-c dock is very, very nice, but it isn't quite perfect.<br /><br />First, a clarification for those who aren't versed on USB Type-C ports:  There is a wide range of features that a Type-C port will support -- it's all up to the manufacturer.  Just because you have a Type-C port, it doesn't mean you will be able to use all of the features that this dock provides.  Unfortunately, you will need to dig into the online documentation or forums for your device to find out what you will actually get.<br /><br />Windows PC -- Almost all Windows PC's will be able to use the SD/MicroSD reader, the Ethernet port, and the additional USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 ports.  On my minisforum u700, this dock provides two HDMI ports and I didn't bother testing the VGA port.  So on my PC and my laptop, I'm able to take full advantage of this hub.<br /><br />LG V40 -- I'm on the T-Mobile service running their Android 10 rom.  In this ROM, LG provided a little-know desktop mode similar to Samsung Dex that makes the phone work almost as well as a desktop PC.  In this mode, the phone takes advantage of the SD/MicroSD card reader to transfer pictures and files, connect to your network through the ethernet port, and provide a large-screen experience through the HDMI port.  Connect a mouse and keyboard and you have a great desktop experience.  Plex and Netflix works extremely well in this mode.<br /><br />Nintendo Switch support -- NO<br /><br />My gripes about this dock:  Being an 11-in-1 dock, this really should have a 3.5mm headphone jack, instead, they provided a VGA port.  If your computer has a type-c port, would you really NOT have an HDMI monitor/tv to plug it in?  Also, the lack of support for Switch means that I'd still need a separate Switch dock when travelling instead of having one dock that supports all of my devices.",positive,positive
B0943XF6RN,5.0,"While I had seen similar products I had never been in a situation where I could mount a dot on an outlet until now.  We recently moved into a new home and I was able to utilize this on our patio - though it required a few adjustments.<br /><br />By utilizing the plug included with the 3rd generation Echo Dot and snaking the cable around and through the inner hoops of this bracket you can secure the dot to the outlet within the bracket as one solid unit and still have access to everything you need.<br /><br />Obviously this mounting method necessitates easy access to an outlet that will be located where you want your Dot.<br /><br />I installed this on our patio and because it’s installed outside it’s on an outlet that has flip open covers so the plug could not sit flush.  I was able to still have this work by adding a small 3 plug adapter I had and securing it with a zip tie.  This solution has worked well and also given me a place to plug my Bluetooth speaker that I leave paired with the Dot.<br /><br />This is a great mounting bracket that allows for a clean, sleek mount without a bunch of wires showing.  Definitely a product I recommend.",positive,positive

B0BCHVHQYX,5.0,"I had to laugh when I saw the gold tips on this cable: while gold connectors might make sense on cables that carry electrical signals (analog or digital), they're irrelevant for optical cables, the tips are just the mechanical connection into the socket which aligns the optical fiber-ends.  So there's no difference between this tip and the black tip of other cables like this (such as the Amazon Basics one).<br /><br />That said, this cable does fit into the proper sockets just fine, and works as well as the other such cables I've tried.  I used it to connect my SBX4 sound card with an Fiio BTA30Pro DAC, and listened to it with earbuds as well as external speakers, didn't experience any problems.  I didn't expect, and didn't perceive, any audio superiority to the Amz Basics optical cable I had been using, so there's no reason there to prefer one over the other.  Physically though this one is just a bit more stiff, so I tend to prefer the more pliable Amz cable.  If that's not a concern, I would recommend buying whichever is available and cheaper.",positive,negative

B00LX1AEYW,5.0,"There are a few things that set the review sample I received apart from most other bluetooth speakers. At the top of the list is sound pressure level because this is the loudest bluetooth speaker I have ever tested. Literally, this can compete with waves on a beach, which can get pretty loud when the tide is changing. I tested it from three rooms away from my writing desk and it could easily be heard. In that respect it could provide background music for a flash mob, which is way beyond the power of most other speakers, which are designed for personal listening on a desk or night stand.<br /><br />The sound quality is also a cut above. While I have tested speakers that are better, this one is still on the short list of my favorites. The speakers are large and powerful, and they do a remarkable job of handling the high, mid and low frequency bands. As advertized the bass is pretty intense compared to ninety percent of the bluetooth speakers I have owned or tested (about fifty!)<br /><br />In addition to volume and sound, this is ruggedized. I mentioned that it could compete with wave noise at the beach. It can also withstand moist and sandy environments and being banged around. It's not waterproof, but is designed to resist it.<br /><br />While the product description and specs are complete I do want to highlight a few features that I personally love. First is ease of connecting this to my phone. When you turn it on it immediately beacons its presence (and announces it in a human voice.) Do a scan from your device for other bluetooth devices and this pops up immediately. A simple touch pairs and connects it. If you have an NFC-enabled phone like my Galaxy Note 3 it's even simpler. Just touch the device to the NFC logo on the speaker and you'll get a message on your screen asking if you want to connect to the speaker.<br /><br />Finally, time and distance claims are accurate. This actually will play longer than most speakers. The claim is twelve hours. I had it on and playing for ten and it probably would have lasted another two hours. So say at least ten hours to set expectations. It also claims to work from 25 meters, which is significantly more than the normal 10 for bluetooth. I tested mine at about 18 meters and it did not falter - the music streamed with no breakup or dropouts.<br /><br />Basically, if you want to play your music loud and still get decent sound this is the speaker for you. It has a lot of features that I did not mention (but are listed in the product description), but the defining one is sound pressure level.",positive,positive
B06XCQKTKR,5.0,"I have gone through many Bluetooth speakers and had yet to listen to one that had such depth of sound as this Bose SoundLink Revolve.  I know it's not the first Bose SoundLink Bluetooth speaker, but it's my first and it blows away all the others that gather dust around here.  Visually similar to my Amazon Echo, I had to let Alexa know that she has a competitor in my home but reassured her that she is still loved.  I can't talk to this Bose, but each time I turn it on, a generated female voice alerts me to the battery life remaining and what device it's pairing with.  Setup took only a minute, the manual is only a few words and diagrams, and after a full battery charge, it's still going after daily use for what seems like dozens of hours.  I'm serious, I have not plugged it back in yet because I want to see what happens when the battery nears death.  I did not want to wait to write this review because I'm so impressed with the audio that is generated from this little speaker that can also withstand being carried outside without harm.  Of course, I'm not willing to test it in the rain, but have to say that my neighbors could not believe the music was coming from this little black speaker.",positive,negative
B0723B58DW,5.0,"This keyboard is comfortable to use thanks to the fabric, and doesn't feel cramped despite the 12&#34; size.

The backlighting is well-balanced, enough to make keys clear and easy to read but not so much that it looks freaky at night.  The magnetic attachment to the surface pro works like a charm, and is so easy it's almost fool-proof.  It still feels expensive (compared to similarly priced mechanical gaming keyboards) but does its job well.",positive,positive

I removed one antenna from the Linksys, used a [[ASIN:B005IKGTXY Bluecell SMA female to TNC male Coaxial Adapter/Converter]] to adapt the included cable to the antenna connector, plugged it into the power supply and checked my home dead spot.<br /><br />My dead spot is the master bedroom and my phone is always complaining about 'unstable WiFi connections' when I am in the room. I used an app called [[ASIN:B004EBZX6W Wi-Fi Analyzer]] to perform the before and after tests.<br /><br />Before I installed this booster kit I was getting a strong reading of  -45 dBm near the router and an absymal -80 dBm in the dead room. After installing this kit the signal boosted to -55 dBm in the bedroom, so this booster kit works as advertised.<br /><br />It's practically worth its weight in gold if you do have dead areas in your WiFi coverage. Based on my experience and how easy and fast this is to install I rate this as a five star product.",positive,negative

B08FG5NRPC,3.0,"The WD_Black 1TB D50 Game Dock has quality written all over it.  Metal construction for heat dissipation, thunderbolt support, nice RGB lighting, and a fast NVMe drive.  It is quite obviously geared toward the PC Gaming crowd, but which segment?<br /><br />The build of this product screams high-quality gaming accessory.  Its outer design is reminiscent of a cargo container and its collection of ports are impressive.  Each USB port is well labeled with its speed (4x 10Gb/s Type-A and 2x 10Gb/s Type-C), two thunderbolt ports, one of which outputs 87 watts of power, one displayport, one network port (gigabit), and one 3.5mm headphone jack.  Add to this, the 1TB high-performance NVMe drive.  All in one sleek-looking, compact container (pun intended).<br /><br />It is obvious that this dock is geared toward the Gaming Laptop crowd, whether its for gaming or for video/graphics production work, but I find that it really doesn't make sense for me.  In my tests, this product does not work without the power adapter (it really should be able to power itself through the thunderbolt port).  This means an additional outlet that's drawing power at all times.  This would make sense if gaming laptops can actually be powered and charged from the 87w thunderbolt port but I have not seen a gaming pc with discreet graphics that actually accepts anything in that range.<br /><br />So what other advantage would this product provide?  External storage through a fast Thunderbolt connection.  At $450, this product provides 1TB of additional storage.  Which 2TB NVMe drives available for much less, I would opt to upgrade my internal storage to 2TB instead.<br /><br />Then that leave the docking station.  The ports are all of the high quality and your monitor, network, keyboard, mouse, headset, and speakers can be connected via a single thunderbolt connection.  This is convenient, but I don't think this justifies the price as there are many docks out there that work just as well, albeit through a USB 3.1 connection instead.<br /><br />WD has really done well to package a lot into this dock but is charging a premium for it.  Personally, I think that there are just better ways of achieving equal or better results when it comes to upgrading a gaming laptop.<br /><br />**update**<br />Coming back to think about it some more, I realized exactly what niche WD was going for:  Macbooks.  Some Macbooks have only two thunderbolt ports and all of them are not easily upgradeable so this product does indeed provide a value to those consumers.  But then does it make sense to spend an additional 35% of the price of the laptop (Macbook Pro 13"" is $1299) to address problems that Apple introduced into their laptops?  I guess if you're already in their ecosystem, it's par for the course.  That's not to say Apple is the only one.  Microsoft has made their products impossible to upgrade as well, but none of these are actually gaming laptops.",positive,negative

It's genuinely bulkier than any headset I've used in the several call centers I've worked in and the only way to be able to semi comfortably use this is to use the piece that goes over your head and makes it a headset. Great for people on the road a lot/ truckers! But for the common person, this is wayyy too bulky and goofy looking.<br /><br />Bulk aside- the sound quality is great. Cancellation of background noise works really well! Battery life is great. It's an amazing Bluetooth piece if you can get past the humongous size!",positive,positive
B089KCSN6W,3.0,"Finally I found a device that worked so I could plug my VHS tape player into my PC and use software to create digital files from our old tapes.<br /><br />When I began this project I really didn’t think it would be near as difficult as it ended up being.  I tested a couple similar devices with minimal success - I could achieve video transfer but no audio.<br /><br />Even with this device I struggled and finally found the only way for audio to transfer was for me to toggle the switch on the side to 16:9 - theoretically this should have nothing to do with sound but in the 4:3 setting I have no sound transfer.<br /><br />The single sheet of instructions are abysmal. Set up is relatively straightforward unless it doesn’t work. The first thing I would try is switching that toggle switch on the side.<br /><br />If you are looking to transfer analog VHS tapes to digital using your PC, I recommend downloading OBS Studio (free software) via obsproject.<br /><br />This device does get warm during use.  Since I only used it for limited amounts of time for my specific purpose it wasn’t an issue.

The keys are comfortably shaped, and have a nice responsive touch.  With this particular Verbatim keyboard, the keys are totally silent when depressed and released. The mouse buttons are equally silent.<br /><br />The wireless keyboard and mouse operate via transmitting radio signals.  Both need two AAA batteries to operate (4 batteries are included).  Inside the mouse’s battery compartment is a small radio receiver that must be unclipped and plugged into a USB port on your PC or Mac for the devices to work.  Also, the mouse must be turned on.  Once the receiver is plugged in, the computer’s OS will set up the devices automatically.<br /><br />I like this keyboard and mouse combo a lot--especially the smooth-as-silk mouse.  A great thing about these radio-controlled devices is that you can use them with any computer that has an available USB port, without having to disable or unplug a wired mouse and/or keyboard that is already installed.

B0791BYM11,5.0,"I wanted to find a cheaper alternative to my wife's wireless Bose headset, something with decent noise cancelling for flights and work.  So far I've used Bose, the MPOW H5, Treblab, and Woltix with ANC.<br /><br />Nothing will compare to Bose noise cancellation - but these Woltix are actually really nice for the money.  The MPOW H5 don't have as good audio clarity as the Treblab, but at the end of the day I got noise cancelling headphones for the noise canceling.  I ended up returning the Treblab and the MPOW H5 and I kept the Woltix because they are more comfortable than the MPOW and had the best low-price ANC.  The MPOW also had some sound interference issues randomly when the ANC was on, and the Treblab had a slight hiss to them when ANC was on.<br /><br />I ended up keeping the Woltix brand.  They just work, they're very light, and they are not too tight on the ears.  The Active Noise Cancellation isn't as good as Bose, but they actually work pretty well for a $65 set of wireless ANC headphones.  For the price, I'm very happy.<br /><br />The ONLY thing I don't like about these is that there is no battery meter display on my iPhone when these are connected via bluetooth.  With the other brands there is a small battery meter.  I have no idea when these are low, so I just charge them like once a week.<br /><br />So, quick breakdown of my experience with these wireless ANC headsets:<br /><br />Bose:  Best noise cancellation, good audio, comfortable, but definitely expensive!<br />Treblab:  Best audio, worst noise cancellation (you can hear a slight hiss when turned on), comfortable, but large and they don't fold down too small.<br />MPOW:  Good audio, good noise cancellation, but was getting some weird sound interference with the ANC on sometimes.  Tight on ears.<br />Woltix:  Good audio, good noise cancellation, most comfortable (way lighter and less tight on the ears than the MPOW), and fold down the smallest.

Two alarms can be set at the same time.<br /><br />The FM radio comes in great and I have it set on a favorite station. You can program in stations and then you can wake with the radio or listen for a specific time before going to sleep. There is a nap, sleep button which is very useful. I press the radio button, then the sleep button and the radio turns off automatically after a preset time ( 15/30/60/90 minutes).<br /><br />This also has a nice big snooze button on the top so it is easy to turn off the alarm when you want to sleep a little longer.<br /><br />What I like is that you can adjust the brightness of the display so it doesn't light up your whole room at night. However if you want it to act as a night light, you can set it on the brightest setting.<br /><br />Also, I find this useful when charging my little speaker I use with my CD player. This alarm clock has two USB charging ports which is very convenient. I can charge my kindle and the speaker at the same time! If you have a cell phone or iPad you keep by the bed, this is also a good feature as there is also a line-in jack so you can play music from your phone on the alarm clock speaker.<br /><br />The only negative I'd say is the AM radio which does not seem to work very well.<br /><br />The instruction book is however great and makes setting this clock up easy. It seems the company who makes this alarm clock really did think of everything. My favorite thing to do is climb into my warm bed, put on the radio with one touch of a button and read to my heart's content.<br /><br />I think you will love this alarm clock and it doesn't take up a lot of room on your nightstand.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",positive,positive
B09YWBVMNM,5.0,"OnePlus already has standard buds which are more expensive than these. I've tried those and was fairly impressed with them for the price compared to other leading brands (*cough* airpods). I'll be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect here with these ""Nord"" brand ones. Nord is supposed to be OnePlus' value brand, and the price reflects that. I've tried out headphones that cost more than this which I didn't care for, so I was a little anxious.<br />However, I have to admit I'm fairly impressed. They sound better to me than other wireless earbuds at this price range. While they aren't as well made as the standard Oneplus buds, they aren't bad at all, especially for the money. Much like the Nord phones themselves, Oneplus seems to know how to make a value product that punches way above its price tag.<br />I know the brand has taken a hit lately with their Android 12 offerings (still holding out for OOS13 to fix this colorOS mess they are in), but I can say with confidence that their earbuds are pretty great and worth considering whether or not you are a fan of the brand.",positive,positive

B001F42MKG,5.0,"I have been using this kind of mouse for the last 10 years and I bought mine from Fry's Electronics and it's time to leave a review about this product. This mouse by far is probably the only mouse you'll ever need, It works in Macs, Windows and even Linux OS. This mouse is great specially when you're playing 8 ball pool in Miniclip.com. It also helps to prevent having cramps if you're using a mouse all the time and you really don't need to move this unit for the cursor/pointer moves every time you move it with your index finger and the controls are on your thumbs. I had terrible cramps every time I'm using a regular mouse but not with this mouse and I'm glad I don't have those cramps anymore. This is another great product made by the people from Logitech and I highly recommend this!",positive,positive
B006K55748,4.0,"These headphones had a mixed reaction in my household.  My daughter at twelve likes to spend some time with headphones on connected to her MP3 player.  She has literal headphones.  I showed her these headphones- or ear buds with loops on them- and asked if she would try them.<br /><br />Her reaction was that she did not really like them because they had a suction and made it feel uncomfortable on her ears.  They did stay in place very well and allowed her to do a lot of activities she could not do with her headphones on.  She just couldn't see to get past the suction feeling.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, like the tight fitting ear rubberized buds because they lock into the ears and close out interfering noise which I appreciate when working outside and trying to block out annoying noise like our next door drummer on days when I just don't want to hear it.<br /><br />The earphones are comfortable and do stay in place well for activities like gardening and running.  They are nice.<br /><br />Some people might not be able to get past the suction feeling, but if you can, these are nice and will stay in place during active times.",positive,positive
B005LKB0IU,5.0,"Based on the reviews of these wireless phones, I was concerned that they might not be large enough for my head and neck, and if said head and neck were any larger/thicker, they would likely be too small.  (I wear a size 7-1/8 hat and my neck is 16 inches in diameter.) However, they fit fine, and seem nicely comfortable and lightweight.  The phones do seem rather delicate, so I'm not sure they'd do well at the bottom of a gym bag or left unprotected in direct sunlight on a hot car seat or dash.<br /><br />I had no problem charging and pairing the headset with my Samsung Infuse 4G i997.  The sound quality is not bad for the price point.  I found I had to dial back on the bass settings using my Poweramp player, but the player seems to work well with the phones.  I also bought a Kinovo Bluetooth USB adapter for my laptop, but haven't attempted that pairing yet.

B07WSKKYPR,5.0,"When I talk to my friends for hours on end the last thing I want to do is hold my iPhone in my hand up to my ear or even be on speaker phone. My husband does not like hearing the speaker phone when he's trying to concentrate on his iPhone. It takes too much effort to talk on a speaker phone for hours. So as soon as I answer the phone I switch over to these headphones and talk through the microphone in the headphones. Perfect!<br /><br />My friend who calls me once a week sounds like a radio DJ, in fact he used to be one but the headphones make him sound that way just naturally. It is really cute. He's always had a nice voice but this makes him come through like rich stereo sound. At first I thought I was talking to a stranger, but got used to his new voice sound.<br /><br />You just have to hold the button down for a few seconds and an AI voice tells you what the headphones are doing. So if you are finished with the headset you just press the middle button and it tells you the headset is off. So that saves on battery power and makes it easy to know when the power is on or off. I find that I can make these the best volume easily and have it now where I don't need to change it at all.<br /><br />My friend who calls me every week told me about these headphones and I bought them on his recommendation. I had these years before I got an iPhone because I prepare ahead of time!!!! Now that I have a new iPhone 14 I'm happy as can be with my headset. Since the microphone is built in this is perfect for phone calls but it also works like a regular headphone if you want to listen to audio on your phone. I haven't started listening to music on it yet but will report back when I do. The sound is just superior to any headphones besides my AKG K553s.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",positive,positive

B09NJJLP4T,3.0,"The good news is that it DOES work, and sounds pretty decent for a cheap no-name brand. If you've installed a double din stereo before, it should be pretty familiar and straight forward.<br />But let's just jump right into the odd design. Why is there an ""external mic"" option that is RIGHT NEXT to the internal mic?  Usually an external mic is supposed to be mounted somewhere closer to the driver's mouth (up by the visor or mirror, or over the dash by the steering wheel, etc). The purpose is to get better sound, and either having the internal one as a backup if you don't want to mount one, or using it to pick up ambient background noise for NR filtering. Having an external nub right next to the internal one makes ZERO sense at all! Why even have one?! If anything, making it lower than the internal one seems like it would get WORSE sound, and if the position were so good, why not make THAT where the internal one is? Not to mention it looks weird as heck.<br />The features seem to be functional at least, but it has a pretty noticeable lag to the user interface. If you're expecting an OEM style menu experience, you might be disappointed. This feels like an old-school web browser loading pages when you open up a feature. Compared to modern units like, for example an Atoto F7, this feels like something a generation older at least.<br />I want to give this at least 3 stars for functional purposes, but the truth is I know that you get a much better unit for not a lot of money more. I can't really recommend it unless it is on an extreme sale.",positive,negative

I later learned I would have to re download my entire Apple Music library to enjoy higher bit rate music, so I primarily use these with other devices.<br /><br />The battery life it amazing. I have not had to charge them in almost a month after daily use of an hour or so. When the battery does get low it takes only a few minutes to get hours of use thanks to its quick charge technology.<br /><br />They are lightweight, comfortable, and the sound quality is surprising decent for an inexpensive set of headphones.

That being said, I have been quite pleased with the bass sound and have not experienced any distortion with this subwoofer at the volume range that I have used.

B09JV4FXBX,5.0,"I selected this mouse/keyboard combo to work with a laptop I use every day. I wanted a full-sized keyboard and I was less concerned about the mouse because I prefer trackballs anyway. So far I have no complaints at all about this combo set, though I am especially pleased with the keyboard.<br /><br />This is a basic mouse/keyboard combo that connects via an RF receiver. The keyboard is a full-sized US layout keyboard, and the mouse is a basic 3-button mouse. These are marketed as having silent keys and clicks, and that interested me in particular.<br /><br />The keyboard is indeed nearly silent. I love the quiet operation and I love the feel of the keys themselves - they have a soft-down feel when pressed. I read one of the other reviews that stated that the keys stick a little, and I have not found that to be the case for me.

I have not tried it elsewhere though I have no reason to believe it wouldn't work on other platforms.<br /><br />I am very happy with this combo set and expect years of service from it.

B012PKUVKG,4.0,"It's pretty amazing to me that you can pack so much data now in such a tiny drive.  It's about the same size as my Logitech mouse &#34;nano&#34; receiver.<br /><br />The drive capacity is almost exactly 32 billion bytes (that's really 29.8GB, not 32GB, but the marketers have defeated the engineers on this).  For some reason it was connecting at USB2 on my front port, where other USB3 drives connect just fine.  Once I got it connected on another port at USB3, I did see better behavior.  However, file transfer speeds are limited by Windows (and perhaps my computer hardware) more than anything else.  Even transferring to/from an internal SSD drive I didn't get sustained speeds over about 38MB/s (that's megabytes, not megabits).  I've read tech journals that say that the smaller USB3 drives can't transfer at the same speeds as the super-duper larger ones, but for real-world file transfer (as opposed to lab benchmarks) it doesn't seem to matter. Suffice it to say that I get about 10x speeds on USB3 drives vs. USB2 drives, and this one works as well as my other USB3 drives.<br /><br />The drive came with a basic file encryption program (you can download it from the Lexar website as well).  This easy-to-use program encrypts files using AES-256 (more detail wasn't given); you can buy an upgraded version which allows upto AES-1024, and has a few other features.  Each file you encrypt is stored in a separate folder hierarchy (labeled the Vault), there isn't a separate encrypted file system.  It's probably secure enough for general consumer use, and is certainly a convenience making it easy to protect your data.  There was a Windows version and an Apple version of the program, so I think it means that encrypted files can be shared with either type of system.  Not being a Mac user, I couldn't verify this.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very nice product for an attractively low price.

B01BW2TLDG,4.0,"I have worked with a lot of Bluetooth speakers and I have seen a good variety in features and sound quality. I have a set of Monster headphones and they are excellent; I expected the same from this speaker. It’s a good speaker, but it has a weakness in the sound profile.<br /><br />It pairs and connects quickly and without any issue. I was able to connect it to my computer without any problems and it was ready to go in less than 20 seconds. In terms of connection speed via Bluetooth, this one is slightly faster than most.<br /><br />I really like the fact that the speaker has a slider switch for power instead of a button you have to hold down. It makes knowing the speaker is on very simple and it also makes it very simple to power off. This is a big plus to me and is one of the best features in my mind.<br /><br />I tested the sound quality fairly extensively and make a few important observations, most of which were positive but there was one important issue. The speaker has good volume (controlled by the source) and excellent operational range - I went as far as 30’ and there were no cut-outs or crackles, a good sign. The sound profile though is slightly problematic. The bass is strong - very strong - and is enough to dominate the whole sound output. Many speakers and headsets are heavy-handed on the bass, so this is not totally unexpected but is a bit heavy for my tastes. The highs are good and everything is clear and crisp. The midrange is very flat to the point of being practically non-existent, likely because the bass is as high as it is. Because the midrange is so flat, the output has a tendency to be dull and lifeless.<br /><br />This is not a bad speaker and it is a decent choice if you want a small and strong speaker. But, be aware that the sound profile is unbalanced.",positive,negative

I don't expect a case to last on my iPad for its life, because like my phone, when I see a case that intrigues me, I have to get it.

B00WJLVWNW,5.0,"I'm very impressed with the quality of this keyboard cover.  I honestly was not expecting to be as nice as it is.<br /><br />I can speak from experience when I say that cats, coffee, and a MacBook are NOT a great combination.  I lost an earlier MacBook Pro when cat and coffee collided over the keyboard, so when I purchased my new MacBook Air 13&#34;, I knew I wanted a keyboard cover.<br /><br />This one has a lot going for it.  It fits beautifully -- lays flat, the key covers are precisely where they should be, there's no slippage or any feeling of insecurity about the cover shifting position.  It's transparent except for the colored key caps, so the underlighting of the MacBook Air keyboard shines through.  It's quite thin so it doesn't add much in the way of bulk, either -- but the material feels like it will survive heavy use without tearing or puncturing.<br /><br />I especially like having all the keyboard shortcuts printed right on the keys themselves.  My version, the OX X shortcuts, is easy to read, and the colors actually mean somthing (blue = primary shortcuts, pink = finder, green = safari, orange = iWorks/Mail/MS Office).  It's a nice touch that lends a bit of color to the rather drab aluminum face of the MacBook.<br /><br />If you've never typed on a keyboard with a cover, it might take a little getting used to.  It has a &#34;softer&#34; feel, but key action/etc. is not compromised at all.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a good product, a nice gift for someone with a new MacBook, with bult-in usefulness beyond protecting the keyboard from inadvertent spills and dust.<br /><br />(Although a sample was supplied for review purposes, opinions expressed are based on my personal experience with this product.)",positive,positive
B00Q58WS4W,3.0,"Time stamp for this camera is incorrect, so I downloaded the OD Cam hoping to be able to set the time.

The app is pretty quirky, half-baked. Once you turn on the app, it's immediately working, it will say ""Connecting device..."" But what is it doing? I haven't even selected their wi-fi SSID yet. Well, even after selecting the ""EP7_XXXX"" id, the password of 12345678 doesn't work. It keeps saying ""check wi-fi and try again,"" then you'll hear the lady voice saying, ""Wi-fi off.""

The camera can swivel, so you can record your funky toes, or point it up and record your water stained ceilings. LOL!  Once you're happy with your recording, you can take it to your pc to view your files. There is no need to remove the micro sd card.

B07J4GVS65,4.0,"I purchased this for my '05 Subaru Outback, which was made before the days of USB ports and 3.5mm jacks being regular features of cars. I used this in conjunction with two other devices - an iSimple IS31 (ASIN: B002U5XPBE) and a YIPIN HEXHA Quick Charge QC3.0 USB Step Down Converter (ASIN: B0918CR35N), as well as a couple cable adapters. I installed it in the oddball center compartment above the Subaru's media console, so it is normally out of sight, and I can store any cables plugged into it in the compartment when no device is in use. The step-down adapter ties into a cigarette lighter which is inactive when the car is not turned on.<br /><br />I checked my dimensions and runs first, deciding to install near the media console and run the wires behind the radio. I already had the iSimple and its own audio jack installed in the center console, so I was just going to tie this into the existing setup. Install was easy, if a bit fraught, due to the brittleness of 15+ year old vinyl and having one-shot at drilling the hole for it. I forewent the rubber gasket to I'd have a more flush mount, so you have to get the dimensions right within 1/16"". I ended up using a stepper bit, and then an X-Acto to finish the hole.<br /><br />The port sits quite nicely in place, the included  nut makes it easy to tighten everything down. You might want a little bit of threadlocker on there so it doesn't vibrate loose, but it's not strictly necessary. You can shave down the back of this adapter a bit if you need the wires to make a tighter bend - I had to do so - but be careful, naturally. The port, even without the gasket, sits about 1/8"" over the surface of the panel, so it isn't perfectly flush. However, it is tight enough that it is out of the way and will probably look more or less in place on a black panel.<br /><br />For me, exercising care to get everything looking nice and clean and stock, it took about two hours total, not  including the iSimple install - which was about two hours itself, with the same level of care - and the step-down converter, which was maybe 30m with the soldering.<br /><br />So far the unit performs perfectly, power is transferred without issue - it seems to charge quickly, but I can't attest to full QC3 compatibility. The only odd-ball issue is that it looks like USB connectors don't seat all the way into the USB jack - some silver is exposed, more than you would expect. Not sure why this is, but it is the same with multiple USB plugs. Doesn't affect functionality, but might give you pause or encourage you to try pushing in hard to get it to seat fully.<br /><br />Would recommend.",positive,negative
B01N17AQ7U,4.0,"I purchased four Bluetooth speakers for my house over a several year period. I have a [[ASIN:B007ZG03DG Bose Wave Bluetooth Music Adapter]], which is not very good and a [[ASIN:B00MPMK3GW Goal Zero 94014 Rock Out 2 Green Solar Rechargeable Speaker]] which does not work when paired with some devices and, when it does pair well, it usually lacks the powerful sound I am looking for.<br /><br />I also purchased an [[ASIN:B00SNBCBBY ION Audio Block Rocker (iPA76A) | Portable Bluetooth Speaker]] at Costco which I absolutely love. As a result, I wanted another one of these but they were no longer available at Costco and I did not want to pay more for it on Amazon. Therefore, Costco had this speaker for $79.99 plus tax. Although, I love my Block Rocker a tad more (because I do not like the lights on this one), this is an excellent speaker. It pairs well with many devices including my Nexus 7, HP Omen, and iPad Pro. The sound is powerful and seems like surround sound indoors. I purchased both ION speakers for indoors but they are more for an outdoor environment.<br /><br />When indoors, the AM/FM radio does not work well even with the antenna. I also do not need the microphone feature and do not like the lights for my purposes. If I were running a disco or was just playing music for a party, then I would love the lights. There are many versions of the lights including a star formation, pulsating to music type lights, just a movement of light colors, etc.Every time I turn the unit on, I have to cycle through all the light settings to turn the lights off. I wish it remembered my last setting but it does not. What I do like is that it automatically turns on Bluetooth and is ready for pairing. My other ION always require I wait a few seconds and then press a Bluetooth button to start the pairing.  This speaker has the option but it is usually not needed. Also, the battery lasts a long time. I have used it for several hours already and it remains fully charged based on the indicator.<br /><br />I love this speakers sound. It is extremely powerful and loud. The extra I am free to ignore.",positive,negative

B0835L6DJ9,4.0,"Most people who have set up audio video systems have had the frustrating experience of reaching the final step only to realize they were missing a critical cable.  Many people spend large amounts of money of the newest audio / video technology then use old cables which, in essence inserts a weak link.  The quality of the final signal can only be as good as the weakest link - that certainly shouldn’t come from a cable.<br /><br />This is a high quality 6ft HDMI Cables with 24K gold plated ports capable of high speed data transmission.  It is made with the newest technologies in mind.  It is robust enough to handle 8K and is built to last.<br /><br />I’ve found 6ft HDMI cables are the perfect length most of the time for connecting the majority of entertainment systems - cable box to TV, DVD player to TV, game consoles to TV, sound bar or system to TV.  Having the terminals played in 24K gold is the standard in top quality audio / video transmission.<br /><br />In regards to the quality of the materials and craftsmanship - this is an outstanding cable that everyone will have use for at some point.

B0099SMFP2,3.0,"I really wanted to love this keyboard. Having a wireless keyboard to type on a propped up laptop while studying was my solution to really bad back pains.  And for the first 2 days I loved this keyboard. The keys don't jiggle when typing, everything about the look/design/feel is sleek and smooth. The integration with my macbook and my iphone was seamless.  The keys fought off dust and crumbs for a week.<br /><br />HOWEVER:<br /><br />1) Please be wary of the fragility of some of the keys. I had only been using the keyboard for the first day or so when I noticed that my &#34;-&#34; (dash key) was loose.  Upon further investigation with a magnifying glass, a small piece of plastic had been broken, which was why I couldn't snap the key back into place.  I don't bang keys loudly or carelessly when I typed, and given that I hadn't had the keyboard for very long, I assumed it the product arrived with a defective key.  After a few days, I looked at my F2 key (bluetooth key)- I touched this key maybe ONCE while connecting to my iPhone- and found it LOOSE! I can't snap it back into place because of the same broken plastic issue.<br /><br />2) Logitech does not have/provide spare keys: When I called Logitech to inquire about spare board keys (rather than returning the entire keyboard to Amazon, because I did really love it besides this key popping problem), the customer service representative offered to replace the entire keyboard, which is great, but he also made mention of the fact they they DID NOT MAKE/PROVIDE spare keys for this model. This means that in the future, if just one key becomes problematic, the customer will have to go through the struggles of shipping out the entire keyboard, etc.  I confirmed with the customer service representative that they did IN FACT not make spare keys (I was shocked), but perhaps I had spoken with a particularly new/tired/unversed representative.<br /><br />All that being said, I am awaiting for a replacement from Amazon (I figured the shipping would be faster w/Amazon's superb customer service), and will see whether the new keyboard presents with problematic keys.<br />Hope the above two caveats help.",positive,negative
B08HHXFH98,1.0,"Clipping (AKA crackle) can be heard in loud passages from local FM classical station. It is as if the signal strength is made too strong - but how could that be? Whereas the simple single wire antenna (which just turned up after our latest move) provided with the Sony box works fine. Could it be that the Bingfu antenna overdrives the 75 OHM FM antenna input?  But how could that be? Or perhaps the antenna itself has a weak internal connection that fails to carry the most strong signal? FM is Frequency Modulation, not Amplitude Modulation so the amplitude stays the same, right? So why clipping? OK. You get the idea.

Also the instructions on it aren’t great, and the app it seems like the text was written by a non native English speaker.<br />The two way communication function works, but’s it’s not great.

What better endorsement then to report-headphones surpassed expectations in functionality and no tech failures.. along with a crispness and clarity in verbiage. Nothing muffled or distorted by poor sound.. word recognition was precise- which is a huge plus with business dealings in finite numbers/details! There’s no room for error which is a lot of pressure for any headset and yet, these stepped up!!<br /><br />Love the ease one can switch from music to phone- buttons are easily accessible and no nonsense to use.. the kind you memorize after x1-2 uses.

I (again not tech person) had no idea that those can't be used with my yamaha receiver, so this is something to keep in mind while ordering them.

B002BA596W,4.0,"First of all, these speakers sound just great, they really do. I'll echo the comments that the cords are an awkward design, depending on where you place them in relation to your sound source and listening position.<br /><br />The power on-off button is on the top of the subwoofer, but the volume up-down control is on one of the satellites. And the sub's level control is on the sub itself. Aside from just plain being a bit weird, it means you're going to have to keep both the sub and one of the satellites within easy reach. Also, the cord that connects to your sound source is attached to the sub (as is the power cord); combined with the controls on the sub, this is just plain awkward. I'm using these speakers at work, and I have the sub on the floor under my desk. I'm controlling the volume from iTunes, so that's cool. But it would be very annoying if I had to be using the speaker's controls all the time.<br /><br />A minor annoyance is the shape of the metal legs for the satellites. They are sturdy and look nice, but they take up much more space on my crowded desk than I'd like. Other speaker systems use more vertically shaped satellite stands, which take up half the space. These satellites are much more squat.<br /><br />I also have one of the better Logitech 2.1 systems, which also sounds great. But Logitech puts all the controls on a little control unit that you can keep in easy reach. (And also has a headphone output too.) That's a much more convenient design. But between the two, the sound of these Altec Lansing speakers is superior.<br /><br />Here's the dealmaker for me -- the bass control on the subwoofer can be turned all the way down, so the sub isn't putting out any sound at all. This is a great feature because it lets me play just the satellites late at night, and I'm not disturbing my housemate in the adjoining room.",positive,positive

It was very simple to set up and I appreciate the fact that it comes with the Baby Pin, which I use all the time with this stand. My only complaint is that adjusting the arms can be a bit of a pain as you really need to loosen them quite a bit, then pull them apart manually to separate the teeth to allow the arm to freely move. Not having had or used a C Stand before, I am not sure if this is a common issue with other brands or not, but I would think that there would be a spring in the arm mechanics that would push the teeth apart when loosening the clamps and make the adjustments a bit easier.<br />With that said, I still love this C Stand and would highly recommend it, as it is very well built aside from the clamps issue. It is as described, and very heavy duty indeed.",positive,positive

B00YCX0XMQ,5.0,my son built a gaming computer last year but I'd bought the case for him - not based on performance but because I thought it looked nice... as it turns out it had no sound dampening padding and it sounded like a jet taking off when it started up and when playing certain games it became such a big concern we took the computer to the local repair shop just to make sure everything was working like it was supposed to.  When the Thermaltake Suppressor tower came up on the Amazon Vine program I jumped at the chance to get him a case with padding to dampen the sound - and so far this has been excellent.  He's opted not to do the water cooled thing since he doesn't overclock his computer and the fans keep it cool enough but it is nice to know that there's plenty of room if he'd like to go that route in the future.  When I first showed my son the picture of the case he was sure the see through side would prevent it from dampening the sound but this case still cut down the noise by probably a good 75%. --- and there's way more room in the case for him to add other components or whatever later down the road.  It's an excellent case and we couldn't be happier.,positive,negative
B08TKXDLQB,5.0,"[[VIDEOID:7cc17d49b6d953fb7dabe1f7014939]] The Sony 65"" Bravia XR X90J TV is a super impressive TV. You definitely get what you pay for. Sony is a brand I have trusted for many years. I actually have an older model of this TV that I love and even though it's older, it still works like a gem!<br /><br />First of all, the instructions for set up are super easy to follow. It comes packaged nicely in a box where it is protected with styrofoam and cardboard. The TV is also covered in plastic for extra protection from scratches. It comes with 2 legs that automatically lock in that does not require any screws or tools whatsoever! The legs are labeled 1 and 2, so pay attention, as there are corresponding numbers on the back of the TV. If you are looking at the back of the TV - 1 is on the left, and 2 is on the right. The TV is lightweight and the legs lock in so easily. I cannot review the wall mounting aspect of this, as I chose to use the included legs.<br /><br />The back right of the TV has all of the connections: 4 HDMI's (3 & 4 for 4K), cable, remote, ethernet, video in, headphones, optical, and 2 USB's (500 mA Max & 900 mA Max).<br />The power cord connects on the back left side of the TV.<br /><br />The remote is super convenient if you use streaming apps! I have YouTube, Netflix, Prime, and Disney Plus. There are buttons for each of these apps which instantly takes you to them. The remote is sleek with a nice design, and is easy to use with no issues.<br /><br />If you use a Firestick, it connects super easily to the TV. You can still use your FireStick remote if you choose, and get the 4K experience.<br /><br />We have an older version Xbox One which we connected to it, however it is not 4K. To get the 4K experience, you will need an updated Xbox which has 4K built into it. We chose to disconnect the Xbox and run directly through the TV.<br /><br />After powering up the TV, you get walked through the setup process. It's very easy to follow and to set up the Wifi. The only thing I didn't care for is that when setting it up, it asks about Samba TV and to sign up for emails and communications. I really don't care for this SPAM and didn't wish to add any additional apps. The set up is through Google TV, which is basically the master for all of the apps.<br /><br />The refresh rate is amazing. The picture quality at 4K is out of this world. Even the sound quality through the speaker is great without using surround sound! There is also no lagging at all. My TV is in the living room which has a kitchen right behind it. Sometimes the kids are in the kitchen while watching TV and I would notice a glare on the screen on my old TV. With this TV there is NO GLARE!! Which is amazing!<br /><br />Overall, this TV blew my mind away and it's the best I have ever owned!! If you are looking for a TV with outstanding quality from a trusted brand, then this is it.<br /><br />Also, the delivery service was different from what I have used before, however they had amazing service and kept me in the loop as to when it would be delivered, and the delivery was perfect!",positive,positive
B084ZJFNKN,3.0,"I've had this camera a few months. The install went pretty well. I had to reboot a few times to pick the camera up, but once it was recognized, that has worked well.  The camera does not clamp securely onto my external monitor. I fixed that problem by getting a separate flexible arm that clamps onto my desk and holds the camara.  I love the physical lens cover so I can easily control when the camera is capturing an image. The picture quality is great. I love having an external camera instead of relying on the one on my laptop so my laptop can stay connected to the docking station and I don't have to try to get it moved over to the center of my desk every time I have a videoconference. Unfortnately there there are two remaining problems that are making me now decide to look for another camera:<br /><br />1. Echos:  When using this camera, is it causes an echo on videoconferencing that others can hear. I cannot hear it. It is so annoying to others that immediately people start talking about it and asking if the call can be done using some other audio.  It definitely happens on Microsoft Teams calls as others have said in the Questions section for this product on Amazon. I can't remember if it happened on Webex videocalls also. Others have said switching the audio source solves that problem.<br /><br />2. Wide View: This may be standard on these cameras. I'll find out when I shop for a new one, but the view is much wider than my native laptop camera. I can't find any way on the camera to ""crop"" it so that it shows only the person during videoconference and not a lot of what is to the right and left of the person. I solved that problem by installing OBS Studio and the OBS virtual camera. OBS allows me to crop the picture and then uses that video as the ""camera"" in Microsoft Teams. That works very well to get a good cropped video, however, the image quality  went way down and it freezes up sometimes, so it is not a great solution because I end up not having smooth starts to videoconferences with all the troubleshooting I have to do to get OBS, the webcam, and the conferecing software to all work together.<br /><br />I hope I can find a camera that works seemlessly so that the now much more frequent videoconferences, thanks to the pandemic, will go more smoothly.",positive,negative

B07DN7XBN3,5.0,"It had been a while since we needed to be able to use a device like this, but finally we had the chance.  Here is a brief outline of the experience.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a power inverter which uses the power of the car to enable you to power up simple things like a laptop (as long as it does not have too high of a draw), cell phones, tablets, etc.  You can also use conventional plugs for something like a mattress inflating device etc.  The cord is pretty short that comes with it, so you have to have longer cables if you plan to use this in the back.<br /><br />There is the option to use the cigarette lighter in the front (if you have one) or the battery itself if you are camping for instance using the black and red clamps that come with this.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT PERFORM?<br />This is not a ""move your house into your car"" type item.  It is sufficient to charge phones, tablets, laptop that is not too high of a draw, but it is not going to run a household on a campsite.  For us inflating a mattress and using it to recharge phones and a tablet for games is what we purposed it for.  It performed very well for the task.<br /><br />CAMPING<br />Our son who is a bit of an electronic tinkerer managed to get a car battery that was from a junked car, charge it on a charger at home and then take the inverter with him camping using the car battery as the base to work from for the week that he was camping.  He ran Christmas lights at night, MP3 player recharged as well as a speakder and then used it sparingly to keep the phones charged and mattresses filled.  The inverter worked beautifully and the campsite was the ""home away from home""<br /><br />NOTE ABOUT INSTRUCTIONS<br />I found the instructions lacking in this, but if you look around online, or have a tinker guy in the house like our son, you will be just fine and find what you need to run it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a handy device that works from your car, or as our son rigged up a car batter from a junked car for a camping trip, this is a great little inverter to have.  It has short cords, but if you make sure to have longer cords to reach the back seat if traveling, you should be able to make it work.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I like this little thing, and even though it is not overly powerful, it suits our needs just fine.",positive,negative

The sound quality was always disappointing, but I had sort of assumed that it was probably due to the laptop sound card, etc. Then today I attached my new Sony Fontopias and wow...what a difference! Yes, they have bass boost, but not so much that it overwhelms the music.<br /><br />These headphones are also surprisingly comfortable. They aren't the typical in-ear shape that gets jammed all the way into your ear, but there's a little more to them than the default ""sort of hang in the outer part of your ear"" that you get with the default iPod earbuds, for example. I like the hybrid, in-between quality and they fit me pretty well. They're not noise-cancelling, but the sound is so good that I really don't notice other office sounds (not even my disgusting cubicle neighbor who eats cookies like the Cookie Monster and sounds completely disgusting - now you know why I need to listen to music at work!). I'm so happy with the sound quality and comfort of these headphones, I'm willing to give then four stars in spite of one very major drawback:<br /><br />THE CORD IS RIDICULOUSLY SHORT.<br /><br />I have NEVER seen such a short cord on any pair of headphones, earbuds, headset, etc. that I have owned. I measured the cord from the jack to the point where the ""Y"" that goes to each individual bud starts, and it is barely 2 feet. TWO FEET! People, that is SHORT. So I'm going to go to Radio Shack at lunch today and buy an extension cord/adapter. So unless you're going to sit right next to the source you are connecting the headphones to, whether it's a computer or MP3 player or stereo, you'll need to add the cost of an extension cable to the price. Trust me - it's way too short as sold, like it wouldn't even stretch from my iPod in a backpack to my ears if I was walking around.<br /><br />Otherwise, awesome headphones.",positive,positive
B07YP13YP7,4.0,"The Hyperion auto dash camera is a decent dash cam for the money.  It is easy to install and the suction cup holder is very secure.  You can choose three different video resolutions; 1296P, 1080P, or 720P. The higher the resolution the shorter the recording duration before the video starts loop recording.  You can increase memory by inserting a higher capacity memory card, it  comes with a 16GB memory card installed already and it can take a 32GB or up to a 64GB memory card.  The recording modes/video files are, Crash detected, Loop-recording, Parking and Photo. You can plug your camera to you computer with the supplied cable to transfer the videos or you can pop out the memory card and put it in a card reader on your computer to transfer the videos.  You can also update the camera the same way, if there is an update to the camera.<br /><br />The camera has other functions as well, it has Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS), Front Collision Warning System, Front Vehicle Departure Warning.  They seem to work, but I wouldn't rely on it.  It just give beeping tones and sometimes it seems random whey they go off, also if you pass other drivers or vice versa it beeps as well.  The good thing is in the menu settings, you can disable the alarms and it doesn't affect the camera recording.<br /><br />Installation is pretty simple, it comes with a long power cord that can be easily concealed under the trim.  The only thing that might be a problem is you need to plug it into the cigarette lighter, so if you don't have another lighter plug outlet, you would have to unplug the camera to for example plug in a cellphone charger.  The camera does have a rechargeable battery built in so it can run on battery power for a while, but you have to have the camera plugged in for a while to charge the battery first.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice camera and I am very happy with it.",positive,negative

B09F5VNNXW,3.0,"[[VIDEOID:2212eb120f801d8851a76eb4e94985a0]] This is a really cool way to make your head unit act like a tablet. If you have Android Auto in your dash, you already know that it is pretty cool but a watered down experience of the full blown OS on your phone. It also relies on your phone being plugged in. This device eliminates that by having its own complete Android operating system on a stick that appears on your display, completely independent of your phone. Complete with play store and streaming apps! It is a very cool concept and pretty useful, but sadly I hit some snags along the user experience:<br />1) You have to wait 30 seconds for it to boot every time you start the car.<br />2) Unlike Android Auto on your phone, you need to supply an internet connection (you can use your phone as a hotspot if your plan allows and you have enough data, but it is extra steps involved every time you boot if you want to connect)<br />3) There is no shutdown/sleep. When you turn off the car, the device abruptly dies and has to start fresh again each time.  Aside from the long boot up each time, this leads to two potential problems:<br />  3a)The time/date resets every time you turn the ignition. If you don't have a network connection for it to grab the correct time, it will default to thinking it is Dec 31st and 7am. Every. Single. Boot.<br />  3b) Anyone who knows how operating systems work can vouch that if you are in the middle of a write operation (saving a file, updating an app, etc) storage could become corrupted if power is immediately shut without warning to the device. There is no warning to the device, it's either on while the car is, or dead when the ignition is cut.  Heck, even if you leave the ignition in the acc position so it remains powered on, if you turn to the ignition position, that momentary cut to the power while the car starts means another 30 second reboot and the time reset to 7am. Very annoying.<br />4) There is no pinch to zoom option, which some apps (like maps) assume is available for the user experience.<br />5) Bluetooth support from a phone is very poor. The unit can tell you that a call is coming in, but you can't answer or initiate the call without exiting the UI and either going back to the head unit menu, or controlling it from the phone. Also, no phone audio (A2DP) is played from the phone because the MStick is using the Bluetooth profile for its own audio.<br /><br />In a nutshell, a lot of these caveats could be worked around with some design changes. The stick could be built with a small internal battery much like a phone or tablet, so that it can sleep when the power is shut off and wait for the user to turn the car back on without rebooting from scratch. This would also solve the time reset issue.<br />The same way that there is a button on the nav bar to pull down the notification shade, there could be a button to enable pinch zooming within apps that require it.<br /><br />There could also be a built in way to attach another display, perhaps mirror to a phone or remote desktop in so that you can set up all your apps, etc, at home in the comfort of your wifi instead of doing all of this outside in the car. Everytime I wanted to try something, I had to tinker outside in my driveway and run down my car's battery and/or waste fuel keeping it running for no reason. Little things like that would make a HUGE difference in the end user experience. This product seems like more hassle than it is worth for the average user, but is an excellent proof of concept if you want to, for example, have Torque running on your car display but not upgrade the whole stereo to an Android powered one.<br />BUT, then again, it sort of begs to wonder why not just get an Android tablet or old phone and mount it on the dash and leave the radio to connect with your phone? The user experience might be better than working around the caveats that this introduces.",positive,negative

B01BHAU6QO,1.0,"I've recently purchased this BT headset and the first thing I did was install the latest firmware due to the reviews I've read.  While it does most of what they advertise the BT connectivity is really poor unless you hold the phone in a stationary visible position from your phone or while it's stationary on a table.  If you put it in your pocket or even in your hand with a normal hand swing the sound stutters and is not worth using.  I've purchased a 60 dollar pair of similar BT ear buds without all the extra features but it sure does work reliably in a way you would expect any headset to work.  I've written their technical support for assistance and this is what they told me after a few emails back and forth explaining my issue and running their tests.  Here is their final reply, I didn't put in the agents name as to not hold the agent responsible directly for this issue.<br /><br />(Bragi)<br />Apr 5, 10:26 CEST<br />Hello Derek<br /><br />Thanks for getting back to us with the results of your test.<br /><br />I understand The Black Dash has some issues when being connected to an external device via Bluetooth, specifically when using it outside. In certain cases we have had a few customers who experienced similar issues like you. As you performed the range test and got a positive result, we can confidently say that your unit's Bluetooth hardware is generally working correctly.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is not an excuse for your Bluetooth dropouts. Bluetooth, in general is a technology that offers us the possibility to pair The Black Dash to many different devices, due to the technology's widespread usage. Never the less, it is also a technology that comes with disadvantages. One of those is the actual dependency of the surroundings as you discovered already. That actually means that Bluetooth works very well in closed surroundings where you have surfaces that reflect the Bluetooth signals. However, when being outside with no walls at all, the Bluetooth range very much varies. Having your external device in your right side pockets, your The Black Dash should work independently from the outside surroundings.<br /><br />Again, this is not an excuse for your Bluetooth dropouts, but rather an explanation for this behavior. Furthermore, we are doing our best to regulate Bluetooth performance with our firmware settings, and every update should actually improve Bluetooth performance.<br />We hope you can understand that.<br /><br />All the best,<br />(Agent name)& your Team Bragi​​​​​​",negative,negative

B001F50UIQ,4.0,"I had an iPod 2GB Nano and wanted to get something with larger capacity.  I did some research and finally bought the Walkman.  I was around for the very first Sony Walkman casette tape player, so the idea of getting a Sony MP3 player was appealing.<br />After using it for over a month, I find it a great little device.  The battery life is amazing.  I charged it over two weeks ago and have used it on multiple three hour car rides.  I also had it hooked up to a speaker in my office and left it on for several hours and it stil has battery life.<br />It took me some time to get used to the navigation, but now I am fine with the difference between the Walkman and the iPod.  The sound quality is good and although the volume could be better, it is acceptable for my use.<br />The major problem I have with the unit is the software.  Sony included one of those mini disc's which loaded a couple of software programs on my computer.  The main program is one which allows you to drag and drop files from your computer to the player; however, it doesn't work.  I dragged a few tunes to see how it worked and then started dragging all the music.  The software kept accepting the tunes, but after it ""loaded"" for about 2 hours, I discovered it had only loaded the first set of tunes.  The rest, and the two hour wait, was for nothing.  The software also has a ""delete"" function, which also doesn't work.  It tells you that it delets items from the player, but they are still there.<br />So, I junked that software and decided to use the Windows Media Player.  This is ok, except that the Media Player has a very odd way to create playlists.  There are some round about ways to create the play list and I have finaly learned how to do it, but it took way too long compared to iTunes.  The other odd thing is that when you create a play list it has to be from tunes on your computer, not on the device.  Then when you sync the device to load the playlist, it may or may not put duplicate versions of the music on the device.  Sometimes it finds the songs on the device and sometimes it does not.  So, I ended up with multiple copies of some songs.  The device software is also pathetic.  It doesn't allow you to create playlists on the device, and as others have noted, there is no way to delete items from the device without using the software.<br />I finally just had the computer recognize the device as an external drive and was able to load songs and delete them with no probme.<br />Despite the isues, I still like the device better than my Nano.  For one thing it has an FM receiver, which works great.  Now that I have come to terms with the crappy software, it works great. So, if you are looking for an alternative to the iPod, this is a good option.  Just stay away from the software provided by Sony and you will be fine.",positive,negative
B07XXG6L26,3.0,"I wanted to use these to replace some older bookshelf speakers in our living room, currently connected to a streaming Alexa-enabled player. I like that these have two auxiliary inputs so technically I can attach it to our audio system and ALSO something like our home theater receiver, and occasionally use Bluetooth to connect to a phone when needed. These are much nicer looking and sound really good compared to my old speakers, however I'm rather annoyed that everytime they power up it defaults to Bluetooth again. My audio system gets shut off at night and turned back on in the morning via a switch. I really wish the speakers would go back to the last setting used, or perhaps have a way to change the default. As it is right now, every morning we have to find the remote and press Line 1 to hear the music, despite the player trying to play. Even worse, if we can't find the remote, there's NO WAY to change settings on  speaker itself. This just seems like an unnecessary extra step and it has made some of my family members prefer the old speakers instead, sadly.<br />It is very unfortunate because these otherwise have the potential to be so incredible!

B00VYSLY0C,5.0,"I received this as a free review sample. Although it's designed for notebooks, I am using it for my 10.1 inch tablet and for that it's perfect.<br /><br />One of the main reasons why I rated this so highly is the protection that it affords. Part of the reason why it's so slim and light, yet protects so will is the interior has an arrangement of raised, circular shapes. They provide cushioning on both sides of the interior. They also greatly reduce shock in the event of a fall. I tested that by taking a functioning - but no longer used - Acer Aspire One notebook and dropping it from waist level inside this bag on a hard floor. There was no physical damage to the exterior of the Acer and it powered up and operated normally.<br /><br />The exterior of the bag has a spongy feel that also diminished shock, so the protection is twofold. Other features I love are the heavy duty seams and zippers, and even the color scheme. On the latter, there is enough red to catch my eye when I am packing my gear and doing a visual scan to make sure I did not leave anything behind. I have 'forgotten' black cases in the past, but this one is hard to miss.<br /><br />Do be aware that there is a slight chemical odor to this bag when you first unpack it. That will go away in a day or less, but it's there and you need to know about it before you make your final purchase decision. Also carefully read the part of the product description that states, ' If your laptop screen size is 14 inches, and the maximum thickness greater than 28mm (0.11""), please do not select this bag.'

B0B45Z96JF,4.0,"USB Type-C is just a super complicated situation all around.  The ports themselves can be USB 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, thunderbolt 3 or thunderbolt 4.  I'm probably missing something there.  That only covers data transfer speeds.  For power, a Type-C port can be rated for multiple voltages and amperages.  To protect the consumer from disaster (or they try anyway), each type-c product needs to be equipped with a chip that allows it to negotiate the speed and voltages.  This includes the cables.  The situation with cables is just as complicated.  A cable may only be able to charge at 5v and not carry any data.  They may carry only usb 2.0 data.  Better ones may be rated for high speed data but not high wattage.  Others have both high speeds and are rated for up to 100w.  Good luck trying to find the right cable once all of them are dumped in a drawer somewhere.<br /><br />This 240W USB C to USB C Cable 6.6ft is yet another odd one in the bunch.  It is rated for high charging speeds but is only USB 2.0 for data.  Why is it necessary though?  I have a Dell Inspiron laptop that has a discreet NVidia RTX 3050 processor.  This means that it has a high power demand.<br /><br />This Dell was also designed to charge only from a USB type-c port and the input power must be 130w.  So began my search for a charger that I can take with me when I'm away from my desk.  I was able to find a macbook style charger that outputs 140w but I didn't own any cables that were rated for higher than 100w.<br /><br />I came across this cable and connected everything up.  During boot, the Dell's firmware still detected a low-powered charging device, but when I booted into Windows 11 and checked its power settings (after reconnecting the charger to the wall), Windows did not warn of an under powered charger as it normally would.  I was then able to use this charging setup to play a graphics intensive game for over an hour with no sign of GPU or CPU throttling.<br /><br />In the end, this cable allows me to have a portable solution for my laptop without having to lug around a standard laptop charger.  It works.",positive,negative

B00V2SLLMA,4.0,"I received this as a free review sample. As a music stand light it's functional, but not ideal. As a night light or even a clip on to a book for night time reading when your partner of sleeping this is truly useful.<br /><br />Be aware that it's small and even at max illumination with all LEDs active it is not glaring. That is a good feature, but the tradeoff is as a music stand light you may have to keep adjusting the goosenecks to get optimum illumination.<br /><br />The goosenecks are a little on the thin side, which is another reason I think this is best suited to clamping directly on a book or headboard (if you can find a spot that the clamp can grip). On a music stand turning pages too briskly can change the position of the LEDs; not a problem when reading a book, but not the distraction you want when playing an instrument.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are looking for a light for your music stand carefully comparison shop.

B0009ZAA4M,4.0,"First of all, my first order arrived with a small crack in the wooden cabinet and it would not turn on. I am going to give Sangean the benefit of the doubt and assume that it was shipping damage even though the box from the outside did not look like it was damaged, so I won't let this affect my rating.<br /><br />But this did give me a chance to test Amazon's return policy, and I must say it was great. When I realized that I had to return the radio, I went to Amazon's website and clicked on the radio and selected ""return."" Then I was prompted to print a return shipping label to attach to the box when I sent it back. By the time I did that, there was an email in my in box from Amazon telling me that they were shipping a replacement to me via UPS Air. So I packed up the unit in it's original box, attached the label I had printed, and then the next day when the replacement arrived I gave the box to the UPS driver. Of course, all of this was at no additional cost to me. I was quite impressed with the whole process.<br /><br />Now to the radio itself. Overall I am quite impressed with it and I am giving it four stars. For a radio of it's size, it sounds great. I have never heard a radio that small with the tight bass response that this one has. And AM radio sounds better than than it does even on my Onkyo receiver that I have in my family room.<br /><br />The radio with it's wooden cabinet looks great on my nightstand and you can just tell by looking at it that it is a quality product.<br /><br />The tuner's sensitivity on the FM band is good with the external wire antenna that is supplied with it. Selectivity between adjacent stations is also good. And I am getting good stereo separation when I listen with headphones. I do have one small quibble however. There is a button to switch any FM station to mono, but you have to do this individually for each station. It would have been better if you could toggle between stereo and mono for all the stations at once rather than having to do it individually for each one.<br /><br />AM sensitivity is pretty good using the built in antenna. Weak stations in my area come in better than they did with my old clock radio, but I still do have some problems with the very weak stations. I could probably improve this if I bought a good external AM antenna, but I don't think I will bother to do that since I don't really listen to any of the weak stations anyway.<br /><br />One reason why I got this radio was because it has a line in jack. I have connected my Directv box to it so that I can listen to the Directv music channels through the radio without having my TV set on. All I had to do was to go to Radio Shack and buy a Y adapter with two RCA plugs on one end and a 1/8"" plug on the other. It works like a charm.<br /><br />I also like that the display has large enough numerals that I can read it without my glasses on. However, as others have mentioned, the display defaults to the radio station frequency or the RDS display rather than to the time. To get the time display back I have to tap the display button, and it's hard to do at night in a dark room. I think it would have been better if it defaulted to the time in the first place.<br /><br />Another quibble that I have is that the power button uses a bright blue light which is distracting in a dark room. They shouldn't have made it so bright. That will take some getting used to.<br /><br />Also, as others have mentioned, setting the alarm is needlessly complicated as is turning it off. You need to hit three different buttons to do it. I am starting to get the hang of it, but I wish they would have just included a button which toggles the alarm on and off.<br /><br />But overall I am rating this as a good four star product that could use some minor improvements. The most important thing to me is the sound quality, and that is unmatched for a radio of this size.",positive,positive

B084P27PDS,5.0,"I ordered the 'Lorex 1080p HD Smart Indoor Pan/Tilt Wi-Fi Security Camera with Person Detection, Two-Way Audio, and Smart Home Voice Control' for review and would like to share my thoughts.<br /><br />This is a great value indoor security camera. The video and image quality is decent for the price of this camera and the pan/tilt works great which gives this camera even more value. Setup was super easy and the App used to access and control the camera works great on my Android device. I am able to use this remotely to keep an eye on my pets while I am away. Overall I am very happy with this camera and love the value, quality and features.",positive,positive
B003L76BJS,5.0,Works like a charm. I used the same wiring that my cable hookup used to use before I canceled it. I have split the signal four ways but I did not need an amp. I am about ten miles from the transmitters.,positive,positive
B075NMVGP7,4.0,"I like it so far, I am using to provide additional ports for additional drives on my Mac mini. I like the form factor. Small lights make it great in a darkened room. I ordered a new cord the day after receiving this. Its a little bit short of my use case. I think most users would have no issue with it. However, I ran mine through a wall drop to hid the wiring and this defiantly added some reduction in available length to use. As to speed it seems to have no issues, copying files and so forth. Currently I am running 2 time machine drives and 2 clones drives with no issue in addition to a Cache drive and several other smaller drives. I love that it provides enough power for my non powered drives.<br /><br />I chose the Plugable brand because the wife already has a Plugable docking station and it works well beyond my expectations. Plus its clean lines helped make it a no brainer.<br /><br />The only con, I have is its easy to press the power button. Be careful how you pick it up or you may accidentally press it.<br /><br />I finally decided on its permeant mount location, cable tied to a mount. It works really well, I am pleasantly surprised at how good it is. I had bad results from a hub in the past and that left me with lack luster desire to be bitten again. However this little Champ works wonders and I am glad I spent the money.<br /><br />You can see it in the attached picture near the top of the ethernet cords and the switch.",positive,positive

B073JYC4XM,5.0,"- I have tried so many different SD cards from various manufacturers, at various price points, in the name of trying to save a few bucks. It was really important to me back when a 128GB card cost $50 or more. They all do the same thing, so what’s the difference, really?<br />What I've found is that it can be extremely aggravating to put up with when the card does not perform well or does not perform at all. I have heard warning stories about cards that are advertised as one size and actually are another size, causing data loss. With that in mind, I have never tried using the very cheapest card or too-goo-to-be-true card deals. But I have purchased cards on sale at the drugstore or even tried some strange brands. What I have come back to is that it’s just not worth the trouble now that prices have dropped so low. When I am trusting 128 GB of data to a single card, it’s just not worth my time and aggravation to have a card that won’t perform. Furthermore, SanDisk cards like this one are all FAST ENOUGH. I’m not a pro photographer, and I don’t have time to figure out whether a card is Class 1 or Class 3 or whatever. I just want it to be good enough that it can keep up with my devices.<br /><br />I have now purchased several SanDisk cards, and each and everyone of them has arrived in perfect condition and works perfectly every time. They are faster than any other card that I use and I've never suffered data loss. I am putting this card into my Fiio X5ii Digital Audio Player, and it works just fine. During the initial data transfer I have already noticed that the speed is adequate, and I never experience skipping when playing uncompressed high-resolution audio files. I have the same card for my Nintendo Switch, and it works perfectly.<br /><br />The prices on these are so good now you have no excuse but to buy good name brand like SanDisk. Just buy it and don't worry about it.",positive,negative
B00C93DDV4,5.0,"No issues to report with this hub. Transfer speeds are what a USB 3.0 Port should be. Supports well even if all of the ports are being used simultaneously. The Powered part of this also makes it great for me to charge all my devices while i am working. when i have a lot of projects going on ill have my project storage devices all plugged into my 4 port then all my charging devices (Phone, Tablet, Wacom Tab for drawing, Battery Pack, USB powered Fan, etc) plugged into this. The Supported USB's with a 1amp output puts the charging through this on par with most wall chargers (not including quick charge devices or the non standard 2+ amp chargers) and keeps me from having to buy a separate USB charging Hub. All in all awesome hub. Cord is kinda short for me but i have my PC mounted on my wall above my head so its probably not a concern for most people.",positive,negative
B00HO5JF7S,5.0,"The Asus has a sleek look with its silver brushed metal lid and slightly rounded sides. Between this and it being JUST under 5 lbs, it makes for an easy transport if you want a laptop to carry around.<br /><br />I noticed immediately the ultra-fast sleep mode.  As soon as the lid is closed the laptop goes into immediate hibernation. After opening lid and clicking to un-hibernate, the laptop is back to active within 2-3 seconds.<br /><br />The touchscreen has a sleek design with a black outline around the active screen that frames the look of the screen nicely. If you put pressure on the top of the laptop lid it does not affect the screen at all which tells of the durability of the laptop casing. The touchscreen has very nice vibrant display graphics that allows it to be seen easily from various angles without too much glare.<br /><br />The visuals of the screen are great, which make for impressive video viewing. Picture is great and graphics are very crisp whether it is a Powerpoint still picture on display or a movie. The audio is great, too. While not a gaming pc, this is a nice one for video/audio usage.<br /><br />It is a very thin and elegant design. The DVD multi recorder fits nicely along the side panels along with three USB ports, a microphone jack, SD slot, network slot and HDMI port.<br /><br />The grooved out design around the touch pad is a small detail that has a nice impact on the overall look of the keyboard and touchpad (the touchpad is a bit of a different design with the 'clicks', but honestly, at this point with various keyboards for various devices, I'm used to things being different and just roll with it. But FYI to buyer). Keyboard is nicely laid out with light/'chiclet' touch keys and touchpad is sensitive without being too touchy. Considering that I also have a Asus Ultrabook S500-CA with a twitchy as heck touchpad OOB, this is a welcome relief.<br /><br />Battery life appears to be great as well. I had the machine in hibernate for approx. 6 hours after machine was fully charged and the battery was not even down past ½ charge after all that time. And while in use, it does last about 6 hours. Considering the size and weight, that's pretty good.<br /><br />Now for some negatives (or at least not so greats).<br />Fan vent is on the bottom which can be seen as a negative to anyone that works with the laptop sitting on their lap. I would imagine that the fan would be blocked in this instance and would not function properly and possibly allow machine to overheat? Gonna need a cooler for this one while using it for any length of time.<br /><br />No SSD at all?<br /><br />It barely comes in under 5lbs. As stated, I also have a ASUS Ultrabook S500CA, which is a 15"" screen and weighs less. It also doesn't have a DVD drive, so.... You're definitely adding weight here for that and a few other options (and losing USB and other ports).<br /><br />No full Microsoft Office Suite/software (you'll have to pay to get more than a trial version or use something else). Just making that clear. - edited as before I had stated 'Windows'. Sorry for any confusion.<br /><br />All in all, this is a responsive laptop with impressive visual and audio that can be useful to an everyday user. It probably has some drawbacks to someone needing serious processing (no SSD), but for a lot of users, this one is good. I like ASUS, I find them to be reliable laptops, their designs tend to be good, and this ultrabook is no exception.<br /><br />For everyday use, I'd give this 4.5 -5 stars. Anything else, take off a star or two.",positive,positive
B004ZG8N18,5.0,"These plus the Bluetooth amp I got for under $100 is an awesome deal for great music, decent volume, clear tones and good bass (given that these are only 6.5"" speakers).<br /><br />I bought these speakers for an outdoor sauna (not steam) along with this nifty little $20 Bluetooth amp,<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074FR4B7H/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />This combination sounds really good when streaming my iTunes library from iPhone X (it sounded even better when I downloaded the free VOX app with *equalizer* to lower the highest frequencies a tad and raise the mid bass slightly. The speakers have good bass and really crisp treble so the EQ smoothes it out and makes it richer without being shrill).  I just now tested them on the table but it really sounded great! I can tell, it is going to be amazing in a 6' x 8' sauna.  I have a small Bose bluetooth player, which is phenomenal, given its tiny size is amazing, but still the bass can't approach like this. It sounds good but couldn't saturate the room fully and as deeply as this obviously will.<br /><br />It took me awhile to figure out what to get for a sauna, weatherproof/water proof obviously, and low to the ground (the lower 2ft of the sauna are much cooler than the warm spot). I first got Polk Audio ceiling mount speakers and built an enclosure and they sounded really bad, but then they advertised self as better for theatre and not higest fidelity, I found out later.",positive,positive

B004MNADZS,4.0,"I was hesitant in purchasing a large TV online without at least seeing the same model at a store first, but I saw this TV with a good blu-ray/3D glasses/Shrek combo that was difficult to pass on. My girlfriend was doing everything she could to convince me not to buy a huge, expensive TV. I was tired of my Samsung 32"" LCD TV and wanted something bigger. I still can't believe I pressed the submit order button, but I'm glad I did. I spent 30 minutes weighing the pros and cons while the TV was in my shopping cart. I wasn't sure if it was my imagination or a sales tactic but the quantity shown was going down as I refreshed the description page for this TV as I was deciding. After submitting the order I went through the ""there's still time for more research and cancel the order"" phase and spent a couple more hours looking up reviews and trying to not look at my gf directly in the eye that night...I survived and a couple of days later two guys carried a giant Samsung box up to my place. The TV is HUGE compared to my old 32"" LCD.<br /><br />Physically this TV is beautiful, thin, it has a clear border, and has Samsung's smart tv WIFI access. The picture quality looks great with deep blacks and vivid colors. There are many options to adjust the picture and sound. My friends come by to play games sometimes and I found out that this TV even has a game mode. Another benefit of this model is the realistic 3D effects. You have to wear the 3D glasses to enjoy the 3D effects, which will add to the cost of the TV if you didn't get in on the combo deal.<br /><br />I did find a dead pixel on the screen during my trial period and called Amazon to exchange the TV right away. I was amazed how easy it was to process the exchange and schedule the delivery of the TV. The delivery company Amazon used didn't provide very friendly or timely service but that's not Amazon's fault. The only thing I wasn't informed of until I was surveyed is that the TV delivery service includes setup and disposal of the box and packing material. Those lazy delivery men didn't even offer any of that service but even if they did I wouldn't let them touch my new baby. The second TV didn't have any dead pixels or other issues. I've been enjoying the TV so much it took me almost a year to write this review. I highly recommend this TV for value, it's features, and great picture quality. It has other cool features such as the ability to stream Netflix through WIFI and use your Android phone as a remote control. I was laughing the first time I downloaded the remote app on my Samsung Galaxy phone and tricked my gf into thinking the TV was changing channels by itself.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- great picture quality<br />- lots of customizable settings<br />- gaming mode<br />- realistic 3D<br />- huge 59"" screen<br />- loud speakers<br />- Samsung smart tv WIFI DLNA support<br />- use Android phone as TV remote as long as you have Samsung's remote app installed.<br />- stream netflix on the TV without extra equipment<br />- software update through WIFI<br />- connect your laptop to the tv via HDMI cable to use the TV as a computer monitor.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- heavy TV<br />- slight buzz noise when TV is on but not really noticeable unless it's really quiet.<br />- you will be watching more TV than normal.<br />- your friends and family members will come over sometimes uninvited to watch TV or play video games.<br />- wish it had more ports",positive,negative
B0742RKNKP,4.0,"This unit is large and not at all like the dimensions listed on Amazon. It is 5 inches high (top to bottom), 8 inches deep (front to back), and 16 inches in long (side-to-side).<br /><br />WHAT COMES IN THE BOX:<br />- one speaker unit with both left and right speakers inside the large housing<br />- one power cord<br />- one FM antenna cord / wire<br />- one AAA battery<br />- one remote<br />- three user guides; one in English, Spanish, and French (I love this because I can keep the instructions in English and throw out the others)<br />- one limited 1-year warranty insert<br /><br />FEATURES:<br />- Bluetooth speaker<br />- CD player<br />- FM Radio with ability for 30 preset radio stations<br />- Ability to operate controls via remote or front of the unit buttons<br />- Clock<br />- Sleep / timer function up to 120 minutes in 15-minute increments<br />- LED Dimmer<br />- USB terminal that supports USB memory (thumb drive) in FAT 16 or FAT 32 format<br />- Line In port to plug in an external audio device such as earphones / headphones<br /><br />The sound this produces when I play my CDs was awesome and music to my ears. I also paired this speaker with my Google Nexus 7 Tablet (2013 version Android device) and my iPad Pro 12.9 and experienced moderately powerful sound there as well. The FM radio was staticky but that was due to the location of where I placed my unit. When I did receive a station, the sound was great.<br /><br />In summary, this produces beautiful sound. As a Bluetooth speaker, it does not produce as powerful a sound as my [[ASIN:B00SNBCBBY ION Block Rocker]] but it is still good. The addition of the FM radio is a nice touch. I also like that it functions as an LED clock. The instructions and operation of the unit take a bit of getting use to and can be confusing but I was eventually able to figure it out; although I may have to consult the pamphlet every now and then. Overall, this is a well-rounded unit for indoor use but the unit is larger than I expected. It is as large as those old AM/FM amplifiers from years ago and has a retro  70’s look (see attached picture).<br /><br />PS For those who are interested in comparisons, this is my sixth Bluetooth speaker. I ordered five other Bluetooth speakers over a several year period.  I have a [[ASIN:B007ZG03DG Bose Wave Bluetooth Music Adapter]], which is not very good and a [[ASIN:B00MPMK3GW Goal Zero 94014 Rock Out 2 Green Solar Rechargeable Speaker]] which does not work when paired with some devices and, when it does pair well, it usually lacks the powerful sound I am looking for.<br /><br />I also purchased one [[ASIN:B00SNBCBBY ION Audio Block Rocker (iPA76A) | Portable Bluetooth Speaker]] and one [[ASIN:B01N17AQ7U ION Audio IPA88 Tailgater Flash Wireless/Bluetooth Speaker]] both from Costco. I absolutely love the Block Rocker (except for when paired with my iPad Pro) and I only like the Tailgate Flash. The lights on the Tailgate Flash annoy me because they have to be turned off every time I power on the unit. Nevertheless, the sound from the ION speakers are usually awesome. The IONs are the only ones I use frequently indoors (even though they are more of an outdoor Bluetooth speaker). They are battery powered powerful speakers and the sound is intense.  If one wants Bluetooth only with the capability of travelling with them without having to find a power outlet, then these are worth considering.<br /><br />I also have a [[ASIN:B01MUG5WIN Sony XB20 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth, Blue (2017 model)]] which pairs well with my HP Omen Laptop and moderately well with my Nexus 7 and iPad Pro. However, this has to be charged first just like the Goal Zero speaker that I dislike.<br /><br />PS My boyfriend connected his iPad 3 to this one's Bluetooth and loves it for listening to Podcasts. In order to get the volume as loud as he wanted, he also used the volume controls on the side of his iPad in conjunction with the volume knob on the Toshiba. On another note, he mentioned that the controls located below the CD player are very small for someone who has eye problems and I would agree with that. What I find inconvenient is that the button to open and close the CD player is there so that when the CD is open, I have to put my hand underneath it to close if I am not using the remote. Nevertheless, he loves this Toshiba just like I do.",positive,positive

B09GM68TW8,4.0,"As an old, retired guy, I find technology still significantly impacting my daily life in two ways. The first is that I spend a lot of time every day online - either gaming in my favorite MMO or binge watching the various streaming services. The second way is that I keep in touch with my far-flung network of family and friends via social media. Now, my desktop pc handles the first of those two very nicely. The problem is that I can get immersed for hours in gaming or in a good streaming show. Social media notifications break that immersion, causing me to move away from whatever I was doing to see what the latest notice was about. If I don't, it could be quite a while before I get around to checking my social media and responding to the messages there.<br /><br />This is where a tablet comes in. I figured it would be nice to have a tablet that quietly beeped new notifications and allowed me to just glance over at the latest notice to see if it needed a quick response or not. Little did I know how hard it would be to find a low end tablet capable of that simple task. This is the fourth tablet I've tried and the first one which could do that one simple thing for me. The other low end tablets quickly crashed and burned for a variety of reasons. This is the first that actually continued to work after the first few days, giving me the notifications I wanted and that I could check out at a glance.<br /><br />There are some issues with this tablet that folks should be aware of. The sound is tinny enough that I wouldn't listen to music or audiobooks on this thing. The visual quality is sufficient for modern movies and tv shows but vintage ones do look a bit fuzzy.  The charge doesn't last quite as long as I'd like it to. The tablet needs to be charged twice a day, even when it's just sitting there beeping when a text message or email comes in. Charging once a day would be nicer but it is what it is. Still, this is the first low end tablet of four I've tried that actually does the simple task I want it to do. So for that, I have to give it a solid 4 star rating.",positive,negative
B097B32KNN,4.0,"After using surge protection for audio, video and computer equipment for more than 30 years I can definitely say not all of these products are created equally.<br /><br />While surge protectors will often boast of great protection, more often than not they are more multi outlet plugs rather than actual protection.<br /><br />I have thoroughly tested this surge protector and it has passed all of my testing.  While only rated for 700 joules, this is typically adequate especially when your home has proper grounding.  Often similar devices pass my tests initially yet fail after the 1 or 3 month mark - that has not been the case with this item.<br /><br />The way this is designed allowed me to utilize this in my bathroom to have all of my toiletry accessories charging at once yet have everything compact and tucked away.  It’s nice that this doubles as a nightlight that has adjustable levels of light and automatically turns on and off.<br /><br />The only thing I wish was different was if on the sides the outlets were more widely spaced to allow for larger power blocks - with that being said having 6 outlets should allow most users to have more than enough.<br /><br />The 3 USB ports are definitely a nice addition as this helps avoid having to use plugs for USB powered devices.  There are 2 standard USB-A ports and 1 ultra fast USB-C port.<br /><br />This is an outstanding surge protector and nightlight that has proven itself through extensive use and testing.<br /><br />This is definitely a product I recommend.",positive,positive

B00U9NDH1C,5.0,"I have a camera cage that I used to mount directly to my Manfrotto QR plate, but would require tightening up frequently on a job (cage would start to have some play after an hour of use). I realized the cage has two mounting holes (originally designed for attachment to a rail system), so I put a second 1/4&#34; screw in my QR plate, and now I have two points of security which not only prevents needing to tighten the screw, but the slight wobble is nearly non-existent now. I realized afterwards that these screws are not only useful for mounting UNDER the cage, but actually super useful for mounting TO the cage as well!<br />The cage is riddled with 1/4&#34; holes, and in order to tighten an accessory like a microphone mount, the threading on the screw and cage and accessory need to be rotated usually. In other words, if the accessory is mounted in the wrong direction, turning it will also turn the screw, and tightening up the screw might once again move the accessory. These have clearance underneath the threaded part of the screw, so they can actually spin freely once inserted into the cage. That means I can hold an accessory in place while tightening the screw, and it will lock in tight the way I want it to face. Very versatile and useful part of any kit!",positive,positive

Read below...<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* For instructions, they might as well give us a sheet that says, ""Search Youtube to learn. Good luck!""<br />* I could not connect to my Pixel Pro 6, it kept saying, ""Cannot connect to HP Creator due to incorrect pin or passkey."" There is no such pin for us to enter. You've all connected bluetooth devices to your phone, right? It just works. This is a rare case, where it didn't work, and it gives you this message. So there is some firmware issue that HP and Google need to iron out.<br />* The feature I'm most intrigued about is the ""WORK ACROSS DEVICES"" feature. You can supposedly drag and drop content across different operating systems. When you advertise something, and you give no directions, then it better be something that simply works, but it's not. I connected the mouse to a PC as well as a mobile device, and I cannot drag and drop. I've connected it to two PCs and I cannot drop. To use either device, you need to switch devices on the mouse. Once you switch, you can no longer control the other machine. There is obviously something I'm not understanding, perhaps a setting I need to turn on, perhaps a software I need to download. It would be helpful if HP gave you some directions. This is so annoying and so infuriating to be honest.<br />* Then a lightbulb went off.. Youtube!!!

At the 6:56 mark is where he discusses this across device feature.<br />* I think it's pretty funny HP, Apple, Dell, etc. All the big boys now don't feel they need to teach their consumer base about their products. They just know that all us Guinea Pigs will be smart enough to eventually make our way to Youtube. LOL!<br /><br />I'm usually not this harsh on products, but the reason I'm so upset is because I wasted so much time tinkering and searching their useless HP website. This is a Vine product, so it didn't occur to me that this product has already been selling and there are already youtube reviews. I didn't think it be on YT yet.

B01HY4W9I0,5.0,"I listen to a lot of music, usually electronic music though I listen to a little of everything. I have worked with a lot of different speakers and I have gotten very sensitive to the strengths and weaknesses that speakers bring to the table. I had high hopes for this speaker – I have always had excellent results with Yahama products so I expected the same from this speaker. It has not disappointed me.<br /><br />The speaker itself is about the size of a cantaloupe – not huge but not tiny either. It's the right size for a bookshelf or as part of a larger sound system.<br /><br />I did not completely understand what was meant by “MusicCast” until I started working with this speaker. In short, it is a wireless speaker that communicates over a wireless network (not Bluetooth). Using an appropriate device (like an Android tablet) the speaker is easily connected to the network and the software on said computing device allows for turning the speaker on and off and for streaming music to it. My service of choice is Pandora, and I had no trouble at all streaming a channel from Pandora to this speaker. The software comes into its own when you have more than one speaker, all of which get controlled separately and can stream different music from the same source device. So, given a sufficient budget (these speakers are not cheap), you can have different music playing in different rooms, all controlled from the same device.<br /><br />The application is not perfect though I have been able to do everything I want with it – play music from  local storage, stream from a service, increase/decrease volume and twiddle the sound profile a bit.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent, particularly when given a little volume. The bass is solid but not overwhelming which is great – the trend of late is to overdrive the bass which drowns out the rest of the sound profile, so having the bass not overpowering the overall profile is a big plus with me. The midrange is excellent as well and the music has the right depth as a result. The highs are bright and crisp. At lower volumes, the bass washes out which is has been the case with every speaker I have used. At higher volumes, I was unable to get the speaker to distort.<br /><br />I am very happy with this speaker. I primarily use with with my tablet to stream music from Pandora, though it is useful for playing music from other sources too. It is expensive, but the sound quality is definitely there. If you like the idea of being able to add multiple speakers to your sound array and you want to design your sound system from the ground up, this is a good choice.",positive,positive
B01BY0262O,5.0,"I received these as a free review sample. Note: these are NOT bluetooth. They are wired ear buds that should fit any device with a 3.5mm output jack.<br /><br />My rating is based on both sound quality and price. The list on these are in the twenty buck range, but the sound quality, in a blindfold test, would fool you into thinking that these are a tier above other buds in this price range.<br /><br />The mid range and lower end of the frequency spectrum seem to be emphasized, with highs a bit compressed. These are perfect for casual (and even some critical) listening. An audiophile would probably not like the bias and compression, but most other folks will appreciate it.  I mentioned the 'lower' end of the frequency spectrum. At the lowest end it is deep, but not thumping (although it will reproduce 20Hz, which you can feel if not hear.) For anyone listening to acoustic or lightly amplified music, and especially music that uses a big chunk of the audio frequency spectrum (for consumer phones), these are surprisingly good.<br /><br />There is a disparity between the product description's claim that there have flat, tangle-free cable and the actual cable, which is tangle-free, but round. I want to point that out because one of the things I check when reviewing is any differences between product specs and claims, and what you actually receive.<br /><br />Basically, these are priced at the upper end of entry level phones, but are good enough to pass for high end intermediate level phones.",positive,positive
B07WKS9C9H,5.0,"Absolutely the best sound for the money. Bonus, the pairing is really easy to use.<br />I have to admit some bias for JBL.

I like that they don’t go in your ear.<br /><br />I think this type of headphone is good for walking my dog at night.

B000JE7GPY,4.0,"I bought this to help reduce the amount of space needed behind my TV stand.  It does the job, and reviews were positive about the surge protection.  That was why I purchased this unit as it actually was replacing a large Monster Cable Audio/Video Surge protection component that I had bought about 15 years ago with my large 65&#34; rear projection TV screen.  That had finally started to fail in some of the plug ins, and I was also reducing the items plugged into it.  Now I just have the TV, sound bar, DVR, and DVD player that needed to be plugged in.  This works fine so far. Will update if anything changes.<br /><br />On a side note, I had thought I would be able to remove the cover to my wall plus as this screws into the wall plug space, but the gap on top of the unit does not cover the opening in the wall, so I had to put the cover back on, but just removed the screw that attached the cover and used the screw to attached this unit into the outlet.",positive,negative
B071DPSVD9,5.0,"I wasn't willing to pay $100 or even $50 for a &#34;good&#34; pair of headphones. I've never liked to hear a heavy bass in my music and I find that most &#34;good&#34; headphones I've tried have too much base even when you're just listening to people speaking. I use these to listen to podcasts while I'm doing many other things. I forgot my phone in another room one time and the bluetooth never disconnected. I love these especially because they were less than $25. Since I've never had bluetooth earbuds, I have to remember to turn them off or they completely lose power. But that's the worse thing about them. Having to remember to charge them. I love that the two sides connect with a magnet so I'm less likely to lose them. ETA: I've had them for 7 months and don't take good care of them but they still work just fine. This was a good use of my money.",positive,positive
B00NJ4AP1S,5.0,"This is my second pair. I love them because they’re designed for smaller ears so my ears don’t start burning or hurting when I wear them. They also do lock in place and won’t budge when you’re sweating your life away at the gym, or if you’re passed out in the library. They do a decent job of cutting out sound too! The magnet thing is pretty cool, they don’t just fly all over and stuff. I had my first pair for 3+ years and didn’t treat them like precious gold by any means - left them tangled in my bag, left them in my car through hot/cold weather, probably say on them, used them constantly, and so on. I only got a new pair because I lost one of the earphone covers. Definitely recommend these over and over again. They’re far better than Apple headphones and any others I’ve tried.",positive,positive

B0001IXUF8,4.0,"The one important thing to note when buying electronic equipment is that once you pop, you can't stop.  Every time you think that you have the perfect system, something else comes along that you absolutely HAVE to have, which leads to something else, and so on ad infinitum.<br /><br />Having bought new surround sound speakers, we needed a new DVD player, and then, naturally, a new receiver.  The weight of this system is a big plus, being less than half the weight of our old one, but the new one's not as aesthetically pleasing with those shiny silver buttons.<br /><br />Leaning over the shoulder of my resident techie, I can now advise as follows:<br /><br />1. You cannot connect a turntable to this receiver; there are no phono inputs. Not good for those of us who still have LPs.<br /><br />2. It's DVD-Audio ready for the audiophiles among us.<br /><br />3. Setup is relatively easy, controlled by two buttons only: a multi control button and the input selector button. This can be irritating if you need to adjust the tone after you have finished setting up, since there are no separate bass and treble buttons, and you have to go through the setup menu again. You can however adjust the level of the surround speakers and subwoofer from the remote.<br /><br />4. No onscreen display available<br /><br />5. No switched AC outlets to allow you to plug in other components.<br /><br />6. In addition to the receiver, the universal remote can be used to control a TV, tape, DVD player/recorder, VCR, CD player and the radio. This reduces the number of remotes you need around you. It has a weird shape that takes some getting used to, and I still use my separate remotes - guess old habits die hard.<br /><br />7. Input jacks on the front make connecting camcorders, video games, etc. quite easy.<br /><br />8. When listening to music or looking at a movie, there are SFC (Sound field control) modes which you can choose to enhance the sound environment. For music there are six modes (live, pop/rock, jazz, etc.), and for movies another six (action, drama, sports, etc.)  However, to the untrained ear, like mine, I cannot detect a significant difference if any of these modes are selected.<br /><br />Overall, the sound from this receiver is quite good, very clean, though it doesn't seem as powerful as my old receiver (a Technics SADX930). This could be due to differences in the calibration of the volume control, but since I rarely play it at very high volumes this is a non-issue. The centre channel seems a bit weak compared to the other channels, but with so many sound options to choose from and customize, it is very possible that I may have missed something and need to tweak it some more.<br /><br />A very nice receiver for the price and features.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 14, 2004",positive,negative

B00BBFZBHU,1.0,"I bought this lamp in September 2013 as a back up and did not have to actually use it until yesterday, 9/16/14. Installed this bulb and noticed a burning smell but thought it was due to it being new. However, the smell got more noxious and then a loud sound came from the back of the TV. Then the smell got a lot worse. Immediately, we unplugged everything and let the TV cool off. Once it was cool enough to check it out, we found that the bulb could not be removed. Obviously, the connections melted inside the casing and, therefore, my TV is ruined! There was absolutely NOTHING wrong with this TV before installing this bulb! Now we have to buy another 55 inch TV! NOT HAPPY AT ALL! What's ironic is that this is considered the BEST bulb replacement! What a joke!

B0131KDMZA,5.0,"I received this as a free review sample. The tripod is fixed height and can raise your camera or phone 5.5 inches. Depending on the device, the lens can be raised even more. For example, with my Kodak Easyshare the center of the lens was elevated to a little under 6.5 inches when mounted, and my Note 4 phone just under 7 inches.<br /><br />While the legs are fixed the head will rotate to just about any position you want within its range of rotation. It will rotate 360 degrees and the tilt angle appears to be 45 decrees (I did not have a protractor of drafting angle handy to measure it.) The increments, within the movement range, are infinite. Note that the tripod can support up to 2.2 pounds and size-wise, a camera with an 85mm lens.  My Note 4 fit within the phone adapter, so that is not an issue.<br /><br />The shutter release is somewhat generic. That is a god thing because like every other one I own it will work with an app called Camera 360 if your version of Android or iOS is not supported. You will not need the app if you are running Android 4.2.2 or newer, or iOS 6.0 or newer. This works for movies and stills, but you have to first place your 'cursor' on whichever mode you want manually, then use the button to control off and on. Also, it functions like a mouse of sorts until you invoke the camera app. On my main screen when I pressed the Android button it brought up the app on which its 'cursor' was resting on. Another feature is you can still stream music to phones or speaker via bluetooth while the shutter release is active.",positive,negative
B0742PTB7N,3.0,"(WARNING- This is an IN DEPTH review of this stereo to help anyone interested in making an informed buying decision.  If you prefer a more brief summary, see section marked THE BOTTOM LINE)<br />------------<br />In my house there is a variety of quality of audio items.  There are those who really don’t seem to care what kind of quality, as long as it is not too bad.  Then there are those who really want to hear definition of sound but they can tolerate lower quality.  Then there are those who are so sensitive to audio that they will go on in great depth to analyze and evaluate anything related to stereos whether it is the CD player, bluetooth player, headphones, speakers, and fine tuning of sound.<br /><br />This stereo system was picked to replace a very old Onkyo which is hanging on, but not for long.  Let’s see how this measures up.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS STEREO LIKE?<br />First of all, the write up when I had the opportunity to get this stereo said it was a mini stereo system (different than it is now).  I expected it to fit where my other stereo system is which was also a condensed system.  Boy was I surprised.  This system is a LOT bigger than I expected it to be, but still will fit where I wanted to put it although much tighter than I thought it would.<br /><br />This system has a CD/bluetooth base to it.  There is a dial which is rather large on the front that deals with volume.  The CD player has the usual controls on it and there is only an FM radio, no AM.  There is an infrared remote which has all of the controls you would need to run the stereo.<br /><br />LIST OF CONNECTORS<br />FM Antenna terminal<br />Line 1 and 2 terminals<br />Speaker light terminal<br />Speaker out terminal<br />USB input on front<br />Headphone jack on front<br /><br />MEASUREMENTS<br />Receiver: 11 x 11 13/16 x 5 5/8<br />Speakers: 12 x 10 3/4 x 16 5/16<br />Speaker cords approx 2 ft<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS UNIT PERFORM?<br />The CD drawer in the bottom right corner operates about average as far as loading and reading.  When playing a CD there were not any problems.  As far as the equalizer goes, there are only five functions (one is flat- ewww).  For this price there should have been more or customizable options.<br /><br />The equalizer options sound okay, but the two that we choose most often for a variety of music is jazz and rock.  Pop, flat, classic seem lack luster for all of the CDs we tried including classical, rock, country, jazz, hip hop, etc.<br /><br />Despite limitations, the sound did separate well on one of our CDs which has very muffled and quiet background noise at the beginning of a song that we have never heard clearly before.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY<br />The highs come through pretty well, due to the two tweeters per speaker.  The mids and lows depend on the music.  They tend to suffer more.  It booms but not overly clearly.  This is more of a mediocre sound that is designed to pump at very high volumes such as for a party.  This is not high fidelity sound if that is what you are looking for.<br /><br />SPEAKER LIGHTS<br />Although they are interesting at first, the lights seem kind of odd.  For the price, it should have had better options.  You can choose colors that stay on and do not blink or change out of seven choices.  You can choose to have it flash and change color continuously, or you can choose to have the lights flash fast and change continuously, or you can flash the light in white.  None of the settings go in time with the music.<br /><br />You can also opt for no lights on as well.  The lights do connect to the speakers by a second wire- it is not in with the speaker connector.<br /><br />BLUETOOTH<br />The bluetooth took a while to recognize on the phone.  We used android.  Once it was paired, many types of music from old to new tracks, and older songs were not as clear or loud as newer tracks.  As far as decoding from the bluetooth, it sounded pretty good and did not drop once.<br /><br />RADIO<br />The FM sound on this was good and no complaints.  Reception was pretty standard, nothing remarkable, but not horrible either.<br /><br />REMOTE<br />Remote has to be pointed directly at the receiver.  There were a few times where we had to press buttons twice because it would not pick up the signals.  The remote itself is black and very small, which makes it easy to misplace.  Marking it with neon paint is something we are going to do to make it harder to lose.<br /><br />PROS<br />Nice and loud<br />Picks up highs very well<br />Bluetooth and CD player in one both work well<br />Two tweeters per speaker is nice<br /><br />CONS<br />Remote very small<br />Lights sometimes are annoying<br />Wires are way too short- speakers can not be separated to put in corners of room<br />Speaker wires are proprietary to the receiver with special attachment (can not use other speakers)<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want to have a good middle of the road stereo with nice separation of highs and decent sound, you might like this one.  The lights and loud capacity also make this a great party unit if you like to fill up a large room or house with sound.  Remote works okay , but speakers can not be separated very far.  Due to proprietary speaker connections, the only way to change that would be to splice the wires if you are good at electronics.<br /><br />RATING<br />This stereo is rather high priced for what you get.  It does not have any bass boost, or customizing options for the equalizer.  The sound is loud, but not overly high quality.  Although this is not a bad unit, it really is not jaw dropping either.  I want to give this THREE AND A HALF STARS due to the price and what you get for it.  Unfortunately there is only a choice between four and three stars.",positive,negative

B08SXPH879,5.0,"THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Beautifully crafted high end speaker.<br />* Built like a tank, it weighs about 7 and a half pounds.<br />* Three ways to position the speaker: Flat, on it's end, or mount it on a wall (bracket sold separately).<br />* From what I can tell, it produces beautiful sounds. However, I'm not an audiophile.<br />* 105 watts, 79dB bass, and 96dB mid-range.<br />* Awesome charging design. The round object you see in the pictures is the charger. The usb-c goes into this object, it then docks magnetically to a round slot in the back of the speaker. Contrary to other reviews that said you're in trouble if you lose this charging device, the back of the speaker has another usb-c port for charging. So if you lose the round object, you're not in trouble. I think it's there for tactile purpose. Without it, you have to constantly turn the speaker around to look for the charging port. With this magnetic charger, mounting and dismounting is a breeze. BTW, Ethernet and Line In is hidden under the rubber cover of this round charging slot.<br />* Works with Airplay, Chromecast built in. If you have a google smart home, you'll like this. My wife is an Apple person, I'm Android. She's been taking over the speaker with Airplay.<br />* 16 hours of play time after fully charged.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Not necessarily a bad, but more like a reality nowadays. You have to hunt for the user manual at their website. No user manual is included.<br />* Bluetooth connection was easy with some of my devices, and was very difficult with others. My MP3 player took forever to find the Level. Not sure if the issue is with the Level or with the player.<br />* Tested it with my Fire TV Cube. Does not work well. I have to connect/disconnect several times to get audio to the Level. But when I change apps, I lose audio again. To be fair, this wasn't made for TV. But cheap $50 Bluetooth speakers can work flawlessly with media players, why not a $1300 speaker?<br />* On the speaker, there are 4 touch buttons that are for favorites that you can customize. Such as spotify, pandora, etc. You can also long press to save a Google Voice command for each button like Play some music, what is the weather, etc.. Initially, I thought this meant Google Assistant was built in, but it is not unfortunately. It's only good for four phrases. Upon further research, I realize that they do offer this same speaker on their website with Google Assistant built in. They have an option that you can choose with or without Google Assistant, and it's for the same price. I guess this option is available because some people don't like smart devices listening in their homes. This Amazon listing is WITHOUT GOOGLE ASSISTANT.<br /><br />Even with some of these ""BAD"" things I've listed and discussed, I still rate this speaker 5 stars because it's the most magnificent speaker I've ever owned.",positive,negative

Only after my visit parent weekend I saw this clock in action: clock allows you to control with Alexa/cell phone- or, from clock itself (mine uses the Alexa 99% of the time- bc it’s easy + habit forming..you can even snooze clock with Alexa!) She LOVES she can charge phone with this unit.. outlet on back. #’s can be a bit hard to read/see on lighter colors- esp. yellow.. display should be polar opposite color of the back light IMHO!

Best yet, 4wk into a 7:40 start for class and hasn’t missed/tardy x1 time.. WooT!!<br /><br />In order to gain all of its perks .. it’s important to note this is a tech friendly alarm!

B001CCLBSA,3.0,"The wide angle lens is wonderful.  The field of view and the speed (light gathering ability) of the lens can only be rivaled by high end camera and lens combinations costing six to ten times as much (admittedly those are superior in many other ways as well).  Still, the point is that no other compact point and shoot camera can rival the field of view and speed of this one.  Nevertheless, some things come up short of fair on the LX3.<br /><br />The shutter lag is terrible.  I am a very instinctive shooter that is quite capable in photojournalist style candids but I am almost always defeated by this camera.<br /><br />I am not a photophile or electronic gadget spec sheet bench racer.  I've done wonderful 8x10 prints with a 6MP camera and 10MP is enough to get prints after substantial cropping.  I have huge film scans when I need them but I cannot realistically show dozens of megapixels on screen or in print for more than a handful of images.  I also shoot in .jpg and it's great.  I can't imagine the agony of terabytes of raw data jamming my PC.<br /><br />I love the LX3 video quality for movies.  It's ideal for Youtube and even Youtube HD.  I do not like the Quicktime .MOV format or the weak compression algorithm.  I wish it had H.264 and wrote an .MPG type format.  It still beats the data format from a DVD camcorder though.<br /><br />The audio quality for movies is terrible.  Again, I'm not talking audiophile critique here.  For comparison, my Sony DSC T9 (ultra compact point and shoot) has far better sound.<br /><br />I hate the manual aspect ratio slider.  If I shoot movies I want 16:9 but for stills I want 3:2 (of course).  The LX3 requires that I remember to both turn the dial and slide the switch or I will end up shooting 16:9 stills.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great camera.  I hope they get the rest sorted out by the time I expect to buy another one in about 3 or 4 years.",positive,negative

B07GLXY253,4.0,"I will say that this is the best Tile I've tested.  However, the entire Tile concept is overpriced.  It relies on Bluetooth, which works well at home, but I purposefully have left one as a test in various locations and came back a few days later having it never been in range of anyone running the app.  BUT, if I'm just getting this for around the house, you can get packs of 5 that work with a proprietary remote for like $10 (with other brands)!  So I'm not sure how much I buy into the concept.<br /><br />Overall, I give this product 4 stars (knocking 1 off for battery life), but the system that backs it 1 star.  My rating above is on this product, not the system.",positive,negative

B00MCHE38O,5.0,"So comfortable! I hate earbuds and finding actual earphones in Bluetooth that sound good has been a chore. These fit over your entire ear and have a full cushion, allowing for extended use in relative comfort. This has come in handy overnight at the hospital lately, trying to rest on the guest sofa next to a family member's bed. I found the battery life to be excellent for music and movies and games....several hours use at a time, turned off and then used again before recharging. I love being able to use the cable when the battery is dead or if you have a device without Bluetooth.<br /><br />I have paired these via Bluetooth with my Fire HDX tablet, Fire Phone, and two new (2014) Galaxy phones - all worked perfectly. The NFC pairing was trickier, but did work on the Fire Phone and the Galaxy Note 4, after I figured it out. The sound is pretty good - way better than any of the other, less expensive, lower end headsets I've had in the past. The bass boost is definitely noticeable...I tried it on pop, rock, and even Beethoven. These are great if you listen to classical music, btw",positive,positive
B01BTJEZ0Q,4.0,"I received this as a free review sample. The reason why I subtracted a star is the grabbing arms are not spring loaded. Indeed, they are a friction, pinion design that makes it a little more difficult to insert and remove your phone while the assembly is attached to your windshield or dash.<br /><br />Also, before you make a final decision, make sure your phone will fit. The maximum width is 3.5 inches, and that measurement is absolute. My Note 4 would fit when I removed it from its case, but with two of the cases that I swap it between, it would not fit. Take that into account.<br /><br />This will definitely stay where you attach it! It even adhered to the pebble grain covering on my vehicle's dash, but it was a but too awkward there for me. It is perfect on the windshield, though and that is its final resting place for me.<br /><br />It's also rock steady, so if you are on bumpy roads the display is not apt to jiggle, which is a nice thing of you are glancing at your phone's GPS map (something I do often.) Basically, this is a decent mount, but not the best (in my opinion.) On the other hand, it's definitely not the worst either!",positive,positive
B06WD61CF5,5.0,"(WARNING- This is an in depth review of this laptop.  My goal is to help those who are truly interested in making informed buying decisions.  This is done from an experiential point of view of most consumers and not highly technical.  If you prefer a shorter summary, see paragraph titled, THE BOTTOM LINE)<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LAPTOP LIKE?<br />I have had a lot of different tablets, laptops, desktops, and have built my own systems over the years.  One thing I have not had is a hybrid laptop which changes from tablet to laptop and back again.  I was not too fond of a 15 inch size as I tend to like smaller laptops, but I was willing to try.  I am SO glad I did.<br /><br />COVERING/CASE OF LAPTOP<br />This laptop is a thin profile, but feels very substantial.  The bottom does not have tiny little rubber feet like some HP professional laptops I have had, but it has solid large rubberized pads that are 1 inch by a half inch.  There are a decent amount of vents in the bottom as well.  The top is a slightly textured metallic top (etched look) and not shiny.  The hinges are very strong and hold the screen in a variety of directions solidly.  They do not budge until I move them again.<br /><br />SIZE<br />I am amazed that this is the first 15 inch laptop that I actually enjoy using!  The size and way that it works makes it fantastic for me.  I can tilt the screen in any direction and use my hands on the screen or keyboard in laptop mode which is a pleasure.<br /><br />KEYBOARD<br />The keyboard is soft touch and rubberized key-wise.  As soon as I touch the keys, a back light comes up so that I can see what I am doing.  The back light goes out in 15 seconds or so when the keys are not being pressed.  There is a full numerical keyboard and plenty of room between keys for my medium sized fingertips.  It is also spaced well for those who have longer nails.<br /><br />SCREEN<br />The screen is shiny.  It doubles as a screen as well as touchscreen.  The view on the screen is fabulous as it has a full HD 1080 resolution.  The colors are not as intense as the Saumsung Galaxy Tab S2, which is one of the most amazing color screens I have worked with.  Since I am a person who likes color, I like color intensity in my screens.  However, this screen is fine and is by no means pale, it is just not quite as intense as I am used to.<br /><br />TOUCHSCREEN<br />When you flip the keyboard back, the touchscreen clicks into place.  You are given the option to choose the touchscreen if you want so there are no mistakes.  As a tablet, I have found that it is very accurate and works quite well.  I have put it through a lot and so far, I have only had a few instances where I was frustrated for a second, but it was easy to correct.<br /><br />OPERATION<br />This turns on so fast it is almost jolting.  My laptops, though usually professional level, often take quite a bit to boot up.  This one, however is so quick it always surprises everyone here.<br /><br />As for operations, I have found this to be a very fast and easy to use system.  Load up is quick and the only problems I have from time to time are due to wireless and not really the fault of the laptop.<br /><br />Turning it off sometimes makes me laugh out loud.  Press button.  BAM!  It’s off.<br /><br />WINDOWS 10<br />I am not a fan of Windows 10.  But unfortunately that is pretty much the choice for any laptop at this point.  This laptop seems to handle it very well.<br /><br />GAMES<br />Because Windows 10 is not as game friendly as previous operating systems, I have not had the time to mess around with games with this.  I have avoided Windows 10 until now, so I have not figured out what if any games will work with this.  I will update when I do.<br /><br />RUN TIME<br />Charging seems to take only a few hours for a full charge.  The run time varies between 3 and 5 hours depending on what I am doing.  I will say this- I rarely run it into the ground in one sitting, which makes it very helpful for me.<br /><br />VIDEO<br />Runs very smooth on here.  Using a DVD player means I have to use the USB port to run my independent unit and be in a stable position to do so.  Works well.  Beautiful to watch.<br /><br />USB PORTS AND SD READER<br />I have found the USB ports to work very well.  No problems to this point.  Load up is fast.  Using the SD reader is also a pleasure.  The photos load up fast and due to the high resolution screen viewing them is really detailed and helpful.  I have not installed professional graphics software yet to test this system for photo editing.<br /><br />TOUCH PAD (AND FRUSTRATION)<br />The touch pad on this laptop is a bit challenging to use.  There is a finger reader which I do not use, but the buttons are hidden in the pad itself and not two different buttons.  The pad is pretty accurate as far as tracking.  The only problem I have is location.  When I rest my left hand on the rest area, sometimes it interferes with the touch pad and causes things to go a bit crazy at times.  I am not pressing ON the touch pad, just in the area next to it.<br /><br />SOUND<br />The sound is not tinny or awful.  I find that it is sufficient for most of the applications I want to use it for.  If I prefer to have a better sound, I use my Soundbot speaker and that gives me even better sound for movies and videos.<br /><br />COMMENTS<br />I have to say that although the touch pad situation does frustrate me now and then, I do love this laptop.  I have always wanted a hybrid because since I started using tablets, I would always catch myself touching the screen when I was using one of the household laptops and it was frustrating.<br /><br />This unit is really nice.  It is so fast and easy to use, it surprises me, honestly.  It is so easy to switch between tablet and laptop modes and I find it a pleasure to work with for photos and movies.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This hybrid is VERY fast, easy to use, and boots up and shuts down so fast it is startling.  The screen is a pleasure to look at, although not as color saturated as Samsung can be.  So far, USB and SD works great.  Sound is good enough for most applications.  This is easy to use and not at all cumbersome.  I love that I can touch the screen even in laptop mode if I am frustrated with the touch pad.  I am very happy with this laptop/tablet hybrid.<br /><br />RATING<br />FIVE STARS!  I will update if I have anything else to add in the future, but at this point, I am very happy with this.",positive,positive

B00ODRSODQ,4.0,"These headsets are light, comfortable, and do a great job with noise cancellation.<br /><br />They do NOT have a longer range than my 10 year old Logitechs though, so don't expect the range to be much greater than your basic Bluetooth.<br /><br />My biggest gripes are:<br /><br />.  When you click on mute in Zoom or Teams with your mouse, you hear a loud MUTED.  When you click again, UNMUTED.  Every single time.  It's super annoying.<br /><br />.  The On and off switch is a tiny slider that you can only really move with your nails, and it has 3 positions, Off, Dongle, Bluetooth.

B09HJMFWZQ,4.0,"The WEWATCH Video Projector with WiFi and Bluetooth is a basic projector that has all of the necessary features that one needs.<br /><br />The description of this product may lead you to think otherwise, but this projector is not really a ""smart"" projector.  It does not run on Android and the built-in user interface is quite basic.  Yes, it will play videos and show photos from USB drives and it has WIFI...  for whatever reason (I didn't really look into it because I simply plugged in a FireTV).  The bluetooth, on the other hand, does have a function.  I'll get into that in a bit.<br /><br />So for video input, you have two full sized HDMI ports, a VGA (for those ancient laptops that your office may have lying around?) and a USB port which outputs enough amperage to run a fireTV, so no additional power adapter necessary.<br /><br />There is no automatic keystone adjustment, but what is there works well.  You can adjust the four corners up and down, although I found that it still seems to have some bloating in the middle no matter how I adjust it (could be a problem with my projection screen and projector positioning).  A tip for doing the adjustment:  If you aren't able to move the corners in the direction that you need, try adjusting the zoom first.  By zooming out, it allows the corners to be pulled up or down more.<br /><br />Audio is as expected in that it is not winning any awards.  It can get pretty loud, but it still sounds empty.  This is where bluetooth or the 3.5 mm headphone jack comes in.  For wireless audio, you can either pair a bluetooth speaker/soundbar to the projector itself or you can pair the speakers directly to the FireTV or whatever dongle you're using.  The advantage of pairing the speakers to the projector is that they will work for both HDMI inputs.  If you really wanted to get full surround, you'll have to extract the audio out of the HDMI wire.  Basically plug the HDMI into an audio receiver, then the audio receiver to the projector.  The receiver can take care of decoding the surround depending on your setup.<br /><br />For the brightness, the 1100LM beats out many other projectors of this price and resolution.  You can really tell that the picture just pops.  It will work well enough in a dimly lit room, but you can only truly appreciate it when the lights are completely off.<br /><br />Overall, this is a low-priced projector that will work well for outdoor, temporary use, or even a permanent setup inside the home.",positive,negative
B091FZK6VB,4.0,"These fit well and feel good on my head. I love that they're wireless and I am no longer bound to cords. They connect and stay connected to my computer's bluetooth, my phone, my tablet, and my tv with no problem. Audio is great for all of these devices from music to television, audio is all very clear! Noise cancellation works great on these, I love to put them on sometimes just to drown out any noise and clear my head. The bass on these is fair, it's not as booming as some more expensive headphones but it has a fair amount. Personally I don't want a lot of bass in my ears as too much of that can be bad for your hearing.<br /><br />These are the most premium headphones I've owned and I love them! If you compare these to really high end headphones- you'll be disappointed all around. But if you look at the price point and what you get- you'll treasure these. For the price point you can't beat these in my opinion!",positive,positive

B085FXFS41,5.0,"I've used cheap Wyze cameras as well as more expensive cameras like Arlo in my garage, but wi-fi is pretty iffy there. I wanted to see if the wi-fi receiver in this HomeHawk beats the Wyze or Arlo, but unfortunately, that's not the case. The HomeHawk struggled in my garage as much as the others did. As a matter of fact, I couldn't connect to it at all. So right off the bat, that is something to note... that paying more for a camera doesn't necessarily mean better wi-fi receivers are inside the camera. This isn't something I'm going to subtract a star for since no cameras on the market can help with my wi-fi situation, that's something that will have to be remedied by wi-fi extenders.<br /><br />Now once I move this camera indoor, with better wi-fi reception, to monitor the backyard, it does the job wonderfully! The app is great and full of features. Be sure you select the proper MODE. By default, it was on BASIC and it did not do any recordings. I realize I had to change it to PROTECTION mode or 24/7 mode. Or, better yet, you can create your own mode! You can determine if it will record 24/7, or only when it detects motion. You can determine the duration of the clip. Now that is pretty cool! The default is 10 seconds, and for several weeks I thought I had to live with the default, until I discovered that I can actually change this by creating my own Mode. You can determine if it will notify you for every motion detected, or only for human detections. Lastly, you can name the mode anything you want, then select it and you're set! I've only used Wyze, Arlo and Homehawk cameras, and without a doubt, this Panasonic software is the best of the bunch. 5-stars!",positive,positive

B00DIWY558,5.0,"I got sick and tired of buying unique cages for each camera I use. This cage is great because it is the most universal design I've seen while still being solid and relatively compact, and most importantly: THE BATTERY DOOR CUTOUT FITS VIRTUALLY ANY CAMERA I'VE TRIED WITH IT! This was the biggest reason I wanted it. I happen to own many different types of cameras (Canon, Panasonic, Sony, etc) and all of them occasionally get used on jobs that require attached recorders, microphones, power supplies, etc. But until I found this, I needed specific cages that allowed access to the battery on each one, otherwise I'd have to remove the camera during a shoot to replace a dead battery, which is just unnecessarily complicated. I feel like this cage is a great addition to whatever I'm using now, and likely whatever I end up using in the near future.<br /><br />As a few people pointed out, the rail system on the bottom has a knob that somewhat obstructs part of the battery door opening on some cameras (I noticed this on my A7s, other types of cameras may still get enough clearance). Someone on youtube showed that they were able to remove the knob to keep it accessible, but personally I just wanted the cage part. The cage itself has the same mounting holes as the bottom of the rail adapter, so you can just leave the rails off and attach a tripod QR plate directly to the bottom of the cage, which is what I usually do. I did one time try using the entire package decked out, with the rails, a matte box and follow focus attached... I got around the battery door problem by using a dummy battery with a DC wire that attached to an external power supply (I built my own adapter, I won't go into the details now but I'm pretty proud of it!). So I was able to swap batteries via an adapter mounted on the cage instead of under the camera. But this was a much more complicated setup than I usually work with. For normally daily use, I use the cage without the handle or rails, and with the camera attached it actually fits where my camera usually goes in my gearbag. I have the handle and rails handy if I ever need them, but the price is great for the cage alone!",positive,negative
B076KRTXQ6,5.0,"**update - no more drop issues - in my review below I was having internet drop-outs, but I found out it was an issue with my source wifi connection.  The CC Vector device is amazing and I'm super happy with it.  The best way to sum it up, is that it's not a super ""smart"" device - so you'll need to connect to a strong source wifi signal - if you get ANY kind of drop out issues with the source wifi, you'll have issues.  But if you have a WIFI source that is strong and consistent, this will allow you to connect to it from very far distances.  I'm very happy with it!<br /><br />**original review below**<br /><br />We needed to get a wifi signal across a property to another building about 600 feet away, a property with scattered trees between the 2 locations.  Nothing seemed to work, and I was hesitant to spend $300 for a solution, and I didn't want to pay for another internet line to the other building.  I tried a few cheaper $100-$150 solutions, but they simply didn't work.  The CCrane kit worked right away.  It did take about an hour or so to assemble and setup, and it was by far the easiest long-range wifi solution in terms of the technical setup - it's no different than setting up a basic wifi range extender/repeater.<br /><br />We connected the CCrane repeater to a 200Mb/s wifi connect connection, and with a 60% signal we were getting only about 10Mb/s download rate - it was slow, but usable.  We generally range from 45-75% signal performance with where we setup the receiver antenna.  I would HIGHLY recommend putting it as high as you can - we got about double performance when we put the antenna 15 feet high vs. 6 feet high (6 feet high gave us 10MB/s performance, 15 feet up we got about 18MB/s performance)<br /><br />After a few months of on and off performance, I started to get tired of the slow and unreliable WIFI signal.  It worked...good enough for browsing, but not good enough for taking business calls, Zoom meetings, etc.  Wifi calling would constantly be unclear.  We also ran into dead internet issues:  a few times a week the wifi signal seemed fine, but would not allow for any internet activity and I'd have to turn off and turn on the wifi rebroadcaster to make it work again.<br /><br />I almost gave up, but I decided to try to use the ethernet ports on the back of the unit.  There is one wifi antenna and 2 ethernet ports on the CCrane unit.  I simply stopped using the CCrane wifi, and I plugged an Asus AC1200 wifi router into the back of the CCrane unit.  BOOM - we went from 10Mb/s performance up to 60Mb/s performance.  NOW everything feels right.  This number would be accurate - CCrane does say you get about 1/2 the performance of the base internet because it's a repeater and that's what they do.<br /><br />Unfortunately I still get random internet drops - the CC Vector repeater will say it's connected to the internet, signals are strong, but the internet will not work.  This happens about once a day and we have to reboot for it to work again.  I'm currently working with their support to see if this can be resolved. (review update - this was because of an issue with the source wifi signal - I ended up connecting a Wavlink Ariel HD2 bridge to the source WIFI router, and now we're getting very strong and consistent speeds without any dropouts).<br /><br />So all-in-all - I'm happy with it.  The included CCrane wifi could use some technology improvements and updates, but I think they make these things for random couples who RV around the country and don't need blazing internet.<br /><br />Once you bypass the CCrane wifi and use the ethernet in the back with your own high performance WIFI router, you'll notice much improved performance.<br /><br />I hope they update the built in WIFI - it would have been nice to just use one router with a $300 setup!",positive,negative
B01J94T4R2,5.0,"This is one AMAZING tablet! I bought one of these yesterday which is Cyber Monday out of curiosity. I already have a couple of tablets but Amazon's fire 8 HD is one that I'm missing and since it was on sale, i bought one. I wasn't expecting much that it would be good or better than my Apple Ipad Air 2 which I bought about 2 years ago but I was really surprised when I got this tablet. Well for one, it's great for the price PLUS you can actually afford losing this because of it's cheap price. But mind you: This is one of those things that it's just too good to be true for the amount of money that you plunked to get this. I put it into a gruelling test and it actually passed with flying colors! From installing Netflix then Pandora then Popcornflix to mytuner-radio to spotify, This baby did it all and it ran smoothly. For the money I payed for my Apple Ipad Air 2, I was really regretting that i should have got this instead of plunking down hard earned $700.00 money + warranty and all applicable taxes. This one amazing tablet ran everything that I installed and then some plus a 12 hour battery isn't too shabby. I looked on YouTube on this tablet on how they dropped this thing from a height of 7 feet facing screen FIRST and nothing happened to it. No cracks no dents it restarted and it ran like a champ! This is what convinced me to get one of these and now it's my very favorite tablet because it's a lot lighter than my Apple Ipad Air 2. I'm ordering a ring that you could attach to the back of this tablet so i can hold it all day long and I'm planning to run this tablet to the ground if it's possible. for sheer durability and dependability as a choice, you can't go wrong with this tablet and apparently, amazon really did their homework on how to make a very sturdy tablet! Highly recommended and I'm seeing this as a contender to the Apple tablets.",positive,negative

Note: I use my headphones about 7 hours per day between phone calls and music/podcasts while I work.<br /><br />The punchline: about 4 days after it was too late to return them, the right speaker blew out. I don't listen to anything very loud. I'm not an extreme athlete who wears these while running through mud or fire. I would classify my usage as &#34;typical&#34;. And they broke.<br /><br />I moved on to a different brand, however I may try these again when those break. I'm not sure why I cannot find &#60; $100 earbuds that don't break after a month. Had these not broken they would've been 4-5 stars.",negative,negative
B01EY1JIUI,5.0,"I received this as a free review sample. M.Erb's extremely detailed and helpful video review of May 14, 2016 covers this in a great deal of depth. I'll add my thoughts and reasons why I also rated this five solid stars.<br /><br />First, I have tested and used at least a dozen dashcams, many of which were excellent in their own right. However, the shortfall in each was the screen and a complicated array of controls. With this one your screen is your smartphone or tablet, and your controls are those that are provided with the app you need to download (for free) to control the camera and settings. There is a separate remote control, which is really just a clicker that does one thing: triggers a short video and a snapshot.<br /><br />Another thing I personally love is the mounting kit. This one, properly used, will run your power cable in an unobtrisive manner (well, as unobtrusive as possible), and the cable is sufficiently long to run the cable from close to my rear view mirror to my dashboard lighter socket in my 2016 Outlander. Other dashcams either forced you to put up with dangling cable or - in one case - have the power and video feed cables professionally installed. Plus this uses a standard USB cable with USB A on one end and micro USB on the other. Some dashcams require a proprietary cable with a barrel connector that makes it difficult to replace if necessary.<br /><br />Video quality is not award winning (indeed, the camera lens is a fisheye), but is still more than sufficient to capture accidents and even scenic drives.  You can also use this for other than a dashcam. I discovered that will fit in a standard microphone clip that fits a Shure SM58 (i.e., a very common size.)<br /><br />You can use up to a 64GB micro SD card, which will store almost eleven hours of video. Most dashcams are limited to 32GB. The instruction manual is adequate, but not comprehensive, and it also does not cover the software and its capabilities. I hope the company rectifies that, which will make this dashcam even more user friendly, especially for novices. However, most folks do not want to wade through a manual anyway, and the one that comes with this will get you going.<br /><br />Bottom line: as far as dashcams go, this one is probably the easiest one to use that I have come across. My FAVORITE feature is simplicity that allows my phone or tablet to be the screen and controls.",positive,negative

B0B28XBS32,5.0,"I selected this clamp for working with my mirrorless camera. There are times when clamping to a surface or a pole is more practical than setting up a tripod or monopod, so this kind of solution is useful in those cases. It's a decent clamp system and it works well, though it does require some messing with it to get used to it if you've only worked with a tripod in the past.<br /><br />This idea is simple here. This is a clamp system that includes a couple of adapters for attaching cameras and accessories so that the camera can be held steady without having to set up a big, bulky tripod or having to hold the camera by hand. It comes with two clamps that can be connected via the ball joint adapter so that the system can convert to an anchor support for a pole as well (not the intended use, but practical nonetheless).<br /><br />Included in the kit is a 1/4"" adapter that connects to a standard camera mount (like my mirrorless), and an adapter for connecting a GoPro. It can be used directly with a cell phone, but it is not ideal for that and does require being creative with the clamps (not recommended); better is using the clamp to hold a selfie stick which in turn holds the camera.<br /><br />The clamps hold tight as do the ball joints. It takes a little bit of fiddling but getting this set up exactly as desired is possible so that you can get the perfect angle. Further, the system can hold a little weight and has no trouble at all holding my mirrorless camera steady.<br /><br />It seems to be made well and so far I have not had any issues with loose screws, stripped components, wobbly connectors (when properly tightened) or slipping grips. It's still early on in working with this system but so far I see no red flags.<br /><br />I am happy with this clamp set-up and I will get some good use out of it. It's a practical solution when a tripod or other mount is not workable. It's not particularly expensive, either.",positive,positive

B01KICHFQQ,5.0,"If you read the product description carefully, you won't waste time (as I did) trying to use this PLAYSTATION 4 UNIVERSAL MEDIA REMOTE to navigate PS4 games (e.g., Journey, Minecraft).  The PS4 remote uses Bluetooth to turn your PS4 on and off, and to control and navigate PS4 media (e.g., DVDs), but only controls PS4 media.  The PS4 remote can also be programmed to turn your TV, Cable Box, and Audio Receiver on and off, and to control and navigate those devices (assuming they accept remote Bluetooth operation).<br /><br />The PS4  remote performs the advertised functions very well, and I'm happy with it.  The main thing I wanted was the PS4 on/off feature, so that I wouldn't have to fool with the skinny button on the PS4 box when I wanted to play a DVD.  But I also wanted something that would make it easier to navigate DVDs.  I'm not much of a gamer, and I find the game controllers awkward to use.  With the PS4 remote, the forward, back, play, and arrow buttons work &#34;normally&#34; (like any TV remote).<br /><br />NOTE THAT once the PS4 remote is paired, you will turn the playstation &#34;on&#34; by pressing the big PS4 button, but you will turn it &#34;off&#34; by navigating to the PS4's power settings (in the display).  (The PS4 remote doesn't have a &#34;sources&#34; button for bringing up the output options on my Samsung Smart TV, so I still need a second remote for selecting the PS4 output.)<br /><br />The Bluetooth pairing and setup for the PS4 remote is straightforward, but you need to follow the directions in the accompanying booklet &#34;to the letter&#34;.  You have to visit several locations in the PS4 settings to add the remote to the PS4 device list, and then complete the setup.<br /><br />Programming the remote to turn on another device (TV, Cable Box, Amplifier, etc.) is exactly the same as programming any universal remote.  You turn on the device you're programming, put the remote into learning mode, point it at the device, and wait for the remote to find, recognize, and turn off the device.  If the remote doesn't recognize the device, you must perform the device code programming manually (lots of codes are listed in the instruction booklet).  The PS4 remote recognized my TV without difficulty, but my sound bar required manual programming.<br /><br />Once you've programmed the various other devices, you switch between those devices by pressing the little labeled buttons (PS4, TV, AMP, CBL).  Which brings me to the only thing that I don't like about the PS4 remote--the buttons (especially the switching buttons) are quite small, because there are so many of them packed onto this rather narrow remote.",positive,negative

B0029Z9UNW,4.0,"I was looking to replace/upgrade my multimedia speakers without breaking the bank. These speakers fit my price range. I was iffy on buying these because I had never heard of the brand before, but the reviews were pretty positive, so I gave them a shot. Boy, am I glad that I did. They arrived in wonderful condition, as Amazon.com never disappoints when shipping anything. They hook up a bit differently than basic multimedia speakers,  but I had no trouble hooking them up. The sound out of these little powerhouses is fantastic. We're listening to Thelonious Monk, and it feels as if we're sitting right at one of his jazz shows way back when. It sounds good with any genre of music. The customizable bass and treble settings, make things nice. You're not put over the top with crazy controls, either. Operation is pretty straightforward. Anyone with a basic knowledge of technology, shouldn't have any problem using these speakers.  The only thing that I didn't like is that the remote gave out after only one use. We can't seem to get it to work now. That's the only reason I'm knocking them a star. If you want good bang for your buck, look no further. You won't be disappointed.",positive,positive

B003GD9G7G,4.0,"First, let me say I own the 47"" LG 47LE8500 for my living room with its stunning high def picture and extremely poor speakers. I was looking for a slightly smaller (and less expensive) TV for my bedroom and chose this 42"" Vizio. Vizio has a similar 47"" model under this newly released line. (So far, I am mostly happy with my purchase.)<br /><br />Both the LG and Vizio have LED LCD with Local Dimming. I have to say that the high def picture on the Vizio is not as stunning as on the LG 47LE8500, but it is close, and still satisfying.<br /><br />The black levels are better on the LG, but pretty close on the Vizio.<br /><br />The Vizio arrived with one of the round rubber ""feet"" missing under the base. (Better quality control and inspection please?)<br /><br />The WiFi on the Vizio is fabulous. The remote having a qwerty keyboard is fabulous.<br /><br />First thing I had to do (for personal preference) is turn off the room light sensor. The picture was way too dark for me when the light sensor was on.<br /><br />Also, the default screen brightness setting with the light sensor off is too bright, in my opinion. The brightness level is at 50 by default on the standard pic setting, and it looks brighter than the 50 setting on other sets. (But it is very easy to adjust, of course.)<br /><br />The speakers on the Vizio are much better than on the LG.<br /><br />I dislike that the Vizio does not have a swivel base.<br /><br />Standard def is quite acceptable (and better than on the LG).<br /><br />So, bottom line: If you want to save some money, this new Vizio line is a very good choice (and recommended). Once you customize the pic settings, I think you will be happy with the high def picture. If you have extra money to burn, the LG will give you a more stunning high def picture with better black levels, but you probably will dislike the LG's speakers, especially if you listen to a lot of music with the volume raised.<br /><br />Adding to my review, August 28:<br /><br />When the TV is off, the Vizio logo at the front is lit up in orange. I have found no way to turn this off. I hope that if enough people complain, perhaps Vizio will release a software update that will allow the turn off of this orange Vizio light.<br /><br />I have encountered bad lip sync issues. But luckily, Vizio has included in the Audio settings a Lip Sync adjustment setting. I had to enable this setting, as the lip sync mismatch problem was really bad. The adjustment has helped.",positive,positive

You don't (or at least I don't) want very loud music when camping....it's rude to the other campers and scares of the wildlife and masks the sounds of the outdoors.

It is the same size as the laptop-style keyboard that goes with my husband's Asus tablet; he has large hands and still feels he can type on it comfortably. The top of the keyboard has four function keys specially programmed to work with Windows 7 / 8, but the rest work as on a regular keyboard: ""end,"" ""home,"" etc. While the keyboard has an off/on switch that works with the function key, it also comes with a thick, rubber-coated (or ""rubberlike,"" perhaps) cover which turns on the keyboard when you take it off and then turns it off when you put it back on. It fits snugly and completely covers the keyboard, protecting it. In addition, the cover bends in the middle so you can use it as a stand for your tablet.<br /><br />I used it to write in Facebook and Blogger, and also tested it with a Word document in Documents to Go. Very comfortable to type with, although it suffers from the same problem with my tablet that my fold-up Freedom Pro keyboard does: when I use it in Blogger or Facebook, it types the first TWO letters of a sentence as a capital letter rather than one. I think this may be a problem unique to my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.

It was wrapped really well in a plain box with a charger. While the S6 served us well, this one is nicer overall (bigger screen, more sleek).  The best part is that it didn't come with any other phone carriers bloatware, & we use Mint Mobile & it set up perfectly.  It came with Oreo, & within a day got a software update to Pie.  You will need a new case, as the S6 one doesn't fit J7 & we have a new case/screen protector on the way.  It has a regular headphone jack which we like, & uses micro USB for charging.

The last one I tried actually had a much harsher fisheye effect in the corners, as well as over-saturated color. This one seems far less cartoony and more realistic in color reproduction, as well as being somewhat more rectilinear (photo speak for straight lines being straight, not as much curved distortion). There is a bit of fisheye curve on the edges, but it is very usable and didn't make my ceiling look concave like my last one I tried. See attached images for examples of the room's wall distortion. It's there if you are looking for it, but not terrible when you're looking at a subject. The microphone is just meh. I have a desktop mic and the sound out of that was MUCH better, especially because you can get it closer to your face than the camera. But the fact that this HAS a mic is a good option in a pinch. I would just strongly recommend an external mic if you want people to hear you clearly. Also something I didn't know before trying this:<br />It is MANUAL focus! That means it won't follow and focus on you automatically, you have to twist the lens until you're sharp in the view. It actually isn't that hard to nail focus, the depth of focus is pretty deep so once you've set it for your standard sitting distance, you likely won't have to change it ever again unless you walk away from the camera. A fun side effect, however is that the focus lens gear lets you push it to EXTREME MACRO distances!  So you can do insane closeups of things if you want to, for example, put a webcam on an ant farm maybe? I tried it out on my desktop speaker, and in one picture you can see the relative size of it compared to my desk and then the closeup you can see the detail of the scratched plastic where it says Harmon / Kardon. Ha, if nothing else this shows me I should probably get new desktop speakers too! These are beat up when up close! A fun and versatile camera for a good price. If you need autofocus tracking, this might not be for you though.",positive,negative

B07T9Y2R3X,5.0,"I prefer this set of Phitric A801 earbuds to the more expensive Anker Soundcore Liberty Air. Both look very similar. Both sound good. Both pair quickly when removed from the case. The one thing that puts this one over the Soundcore ones is that it actually fits securely and will not fall off.<br /><br />I'm not talking about during extreme exercise or sports because to be honest, I'm way too out of shape to do either. I'm talking about sitting at my desk at work, perfectly still, and the Soundcore ones just slip right off and onto the floor. I have not had this issue with these Phitric ones. One reason I think is because of the weight. The Phitric earbuds feel much lighter than the Soundcore and I think that is helping the Phitric earbuds stay in place.",positive,positive

When we got a new desktop computer with new speakers and new webcam, there were cords going all over the place! These labels were recommended to me by someone, so I ended up purchasing them... And I was NOT disappointed. Super easy to use and there are a LOT of them. Plus, I like that they give you 5 different colors. The labels stick on the tabs just fine and the tabs themselves seem quite sturdy. Not only did I label all the cords running underneath the computer, but I also labeled everyone's phone chargers, the camera charger cords, and the wireless headphone charger. My dad saw what I had done (my masterpiece) and quickly bought some for himself so he could label his thousands of Christmas lights & cords... Really, they can be used to label pretty much anything. (Keep in mind that the tabs are zip-ties, so you can label anything that can be zip-tied.) I would highly recommend these to anyone!",positive,positive
B00AZZSAXY,4.0,"I received this as a free review sample. Mine has been affixed to the back of my vehicle for nearly a month, and has even weathered a storm and a few hot days.<br /><br />If you properly prepare the surface of where you intend to affix this sticker it will stay put. The reason why I docked it a star is because there were no instructions other than a terse three step blurb on the package. Frankly, that did not go far enough.<br /><br />You need to make sure the surface to which you are going to affix the sticker is ABSOLUTELY clean. A good rubdown with alcohol or even Windex, followed by a thorough drying with a lint free cloth works wonders. Also, do not affix it in the hot sun, and also let it sit in the shade or garage for at least eight hours before driving. I did mine in the early evening and by morning it was firmly in place.<br /><br />One nice thing about this, aside from the decorative aspect, is it's highly reflective. Since there is not much continuous surface in the design, it is not going to reflect back to a driver behind you and blind him or her, but there more than enough reflection to be easily seen on a dark night.",positive,negative

While my PC is connected with a long series of AUX cables and extenders, I can still use the headset while my PS5 is turned off. Finally!

B09TG9G5JJ,5.0,"I have started using this laptop as my everyday device and I am loving the speed and versatility!<br />This is my first 2 in 1, and I am not sure how often I would use it as a tablet, as it is fairly bulky and kind of heavy for a tablet. Functionally, it is great. The touchscreen is very responsive and it flips back and forth between orientations quickly.<br />As a laptop, it has a 500GB SSD, which is very speedy and good capacity. Their is only 8GB of RAM, which I will likely upgrade soon, but I have not had any issues with it being limited by RAM so far.<br />For standard browsing and streaming, it has been very quick and I have had NO issues. The speakers aren't the best, but a huge upgrade from my last laptop.<br />It does not have a dedicated graphics card, but I have done some light gaming (World of Warcraft, Diablo 3/Immortal) and it has held up with no lag so far! I don't think it would handle new, graphics intensive games well, but that is to be expected from any integrated graphics card.<br />One note, if you have this in laptop mode and flush with your desk/lap it will get fairly warm. The main air flow in on the bottom and the back, so I would prop it up a bit for better cooling.<br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this as an everyday laptop, with touchscreen/tablet mode available as needed!",positive,positive

B092TFTF4P,5.0,"Ok, so I have to admit at first I was wondering why someone would spend this much on a Bluetooth headset that isn't a feature-rich entertainment one like those from Sony or a major fad brand like Beats, both of which I have some experience with. But this, no... this is actually something different. This is a serious tool for serious use with serious built quality and seriously useful features. Seriously.<br />For example, the telescoping mouthpiece means you'll get unparalleled mic quality compared to headsets that pick the mic up by your ears (looking at YOU, airpods!), both in clarity and isolation from background noise. You can also physically bend it out of the way, or use the button on the mic itself to mute. Try doing that with airpods. Then there's the button based features. Shortcuts and touch-sensitive buttons are cool on aesthetic devices, but the physical controls on this are an ergonomic user experience DREAM. Everything is easy to access and control, no apps or press-and-hold or counting LED blinks, etc. Sort of makes me miss the old days of phones with physical switches and buttons. When you want your equipment to get serious, this is the sort of user experience  you expect. Then there's the charging rack. OMG I love that, I can store it on my desk and it's charging automagically. Pick it up and put it on, ready to go. Never needs to be charged because it's been charging in between uses. Finally, I'm really impressed with the USB dongle option. You see, the one thing I really dislike about wireless headphones is that you usually need to pair it with a device, then unpair it to switch to another device. For example, using my Sony headphones on my phone and tablet, if my wife wants to borrow them for a zoom meeting, I need to pair with her device but then also unpair with mine so that it doesn't keep trying to reconnect to it. Sometimes we just give up and use a wired headset to avoid that mess. Non-bluetooth wireless headsets have a dongle, which makes it easy to swap what you are connected to (no unpairing needed, just move the dongle) but then you can't connect to devices without a USB port like a phone. This is the best of both- you can pair it with your phone, but ALSO use the USB to quickly connect with your desktop or laptop without going through the process of pairing and unpairing. This is the kind of usability and professional quality I would expect from a brand like Plantronics, and all the while it works well as a stereo headset for music/gaming/etc as well. Very comfortable to wear for long hours, I'd highly recommend it for serious users.",positive,positive

Plus they are super easy to put on and it comes with a skinning tool to help you put them on your earbuds. Now, they don't work on the flat cabled earbuds but they work perfect on the round ones, which these are made for. Maybe they will expand their skinz and make them for the flat cables one day but for now what they have is amazing and if you have earbuds you need these for them to keep them safe.

B003EGIE2S,4.0,"Banana connectors fit much tighter than a RCA connector and for a person unaware of the difference; it would be easy to cause damage on ether end of the speaker wire to the female connected components. Therefore, I would recommend studying the literature or talking to the manufacture (for both connected ends if necessary). For instance,: in most cases if unaware, it would be easy to cause physical damage simply installing a banana male into a female component just by the tightness, (no clearance between M/FM parts that can fool you into thinking this is as it should be because the male banana is designed to squeeze into the female end and, probably remain as such even after someone trips over an AV receiver  speaker wire, and the A/V falls on the floor because the banana connector was so tight you could lift the A/V by the speaker wire. A banana male connector is designed to expand during installation. If you are in need of banana connectors, these connectors are extremely well made and are a very good bang for the buck.  They are also reusable and do not need any special tools other than basic wire strippers.",positive,positive

B081BB39F1,4.0,"The batteries are decent for budget brand rechargeable cells, they back a very usable amount of mAh for my kids RC toys and game controllers. The charger is interesting however... unlike my other battery chargers which feed from the AC wall outlet, this uses USB. It has both micro USB and USB-C, which is very useful because I use both for different kinds of devices and I readily have one or other available and can choose accordingly. Options are good. What isn't as good, however, is that most of my USB sources won't feed enough amps to charge 8 batteries at a time with any sort of ""high speed"". Even a 2.5Amp charger won't really feed enough juice to charge all 8 rapidly, and most of my chargers / laptops / etc are feeding more like 0.5amp anyway. Those are much slower.<br />That's not necessarily a bad thing- slow charging is actually well known to be better for battery life. I'd rather charge up 8 at a time slowly than 4 rapidly followed by another 4 in the same amount of time as 8 slowly. But it is kind of misleading to claim this is a fast charger.",positive,negative

B002HWRZ2K,3.0,"I ordered this speaker set online as a replacement for an old Logitech set that I had and I really miss my old one. :( The sound on this one is just okay, but sadly there are no knobs on it to control the bass and the trebel separately so you cannot get great sound or bass for parties etc like I could with my last model. It also means you're stuck with bass if your roommates want to sleep which has cut down my music listening time quite a bit. The remote control is handy but only has on/off and volume features which is disappointing because I thought the ability to change bass and trebel would be there as well. Last but not least, I hate the way the remote is attached to the speakers. It has a Y shaped cord so it constantly gets wrapped up in my mouse cord or power cord to my lap top. It is a fairly inflexible cord so it is constantly in the way. The sound is quality and I like Logitech speakers but I would definitely recommend ordering the version with the ability to control the subwoofer independently.",positive,negative

B017VXU6GG,5.0,"More electronics in the home means a need for more outlets. An ordinary extension cord will do the trick, but if you want something that looks nicer, has more functionality, and protects against power surges than one good option is the APC P11U2 APC Surge Arrest.<br /><br />This surge protection device is great for those who need extra outlets for plugging in electronics and other things. It has eleven sockets plus 2 USB ports for a total of 13 places to plug things in and keep them running. An indicator light will tell you if there is an overload, which is highly possible when there are so any plugs. We don’t have this problem because we use this on our kid’s tech table. It allows them to plug in their cell phones, tablets, kindles, and other items- all which use minimal power- and get everything charged all at once without them fighting over limited outlet availability.<br /><br />Each of the outlets on this surge protector has a safety closure, which is good for keeping out unwanted items. This can be useful if you have young children- wouldn’t want junior sticking a paper clip or other item inside one of the sockets. And a light glows to indicate that the surge protection is working as it should.<br /><br />If I could change one thing about this, it would be the length of the cord. It would be better if it was just a little longer because it would be capable of reaching further. But other than that, this surge protector has worked just fine for my needs. It has ample space to plug in and charge all of our household electronics, keeping them ready for use and protecting against power spikes in the process.",positive,positive

It's really nice that it has auto light correction because I'm tired of having to use ""auto-fix"" on my pictures!  I have tested it out by using my main light (ceiling fan light - the brightest in my room) and also with just a small desk lamp, both producing very good images.  Good enough that you can see the name of the water bottle behind me on the floor, I thought that was neat.<br /><br />Also the filters are fun to play with.  I guess once I learn how to edit a video I will try my hand at youtube.<br /><br />As far as the video capabilities, I use the video aspect every day as I started a personal vlog.  The built-in microphone is excellent!  I also use my webcam for Skype calls/video conferences.  So far I have not experienced any lag.  The microphone is very sensitive... I recorded a diary entry when it was raining the other day and when I replayed it I could hear the raindrops very pronounced.  Glad my dogs weren't barking.<br /><br />If anyone wants to see the clarity of the images, I used my webcam to take a picture of myself today which I'm using as my new profile picture on here.<br /><br />I have triple monitors and have tried sitting the webcam on each with no issues.  The brand of monitors I use are Dell, and two Acers.  17"" WS LCD, 20"" LCD, and 20"" WS LCD.

They are very different mice, for different people though.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-excellent feel. the ergonomics are on point, and it's honestly a pleasure to hold. slides nicely on any surface, weight is perfect, and fatigue is zero.<br />-separate buttons. so tired of the trend of mice that have one piece of plastic on top, rather than individual cut out buttons. (e.g. razer deathadder) it looks nice, but feels like crap.<br />-the auto switch scroll mechanism. I miss it on all other mice now. my G900 has a mechanical button to switch modes, and while that is nice, it's not as incredibly satisfying and intuitive as the MX master<br />-beautiful. my office mates are jealous<br />-LONG battery life. I forget it needs to be charged after 3 weeks to a month, which is about when it starts blinking at me. (I use it 4-8 hours a day at work), and when it does charge, the charge port is in a perfect place to not impede your work.<br />-excellent bluetooth. I leave it on my desk at night, and when sit down with my laptop it wakes right up and immediately works. I've had some input lag issues with it, but those are few and far between, and can be fixed by flipping the switch.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />-the side scroll wheel. It's a nice feature, but doesn't respond all that well in GIMP or chrome. it's always either too sensitive or not enough. that said, it's the best side wheel i've ever used. they must be hard to do right or something.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-mine came with a bump in the scroll wheel, due to bad molding. normally this wouldn't be a complaint, but for a $100 mouse (at time of purchase) it better be absolutely perfect.<br />-back and forward buttons are tiny. you get used to them for sure, but a more conventional layout would be a lot better, and more efficient.<br />-the gesture control button. might as well have just omitted it. It has its uses, but it's so awkward to press (the actual button is on the seam of the plastic and the metal) that it is 99% of the time easier to just do the thing the gesture was replacing. now, if the button had been under where your thumb rests naturally, this might have been in the pros category.<br />-the omission of side clicks on the scroll wheel.

B07ZMV33SZ,5.0,"I have been working out of detached workshop behind my house & set this in front of my house to capture the circular drive. It's not excessively far but it's out of range for a bluetooth device reach. It rings if anything goes through the circle (where the Camaro is) or down the drive past the house. I have tested it by walking at the very edge of the drive & it hasn't failed to alert. I may adjust the settings down before I move the receiver inside because it picks up a lot of cat activity. I didn't realize how many neighborhood cats stroll through my drive early in the morning.<br />I wanted to check this out before I committed to a mounting place so I set it under that oak tree. I thought it might be too shady to maintain the solar power requirements but it's been there a week with no issues. It's so discrete I'll probably just keep it on the rocks & move it closer to the tree. The mounting hardware is pretty nice, though, with a ball-jointed mount that sets up easy since it comes apart & has a lot of adjustment.<br />The receiver has three or 4 chimes & none of them are subtle. It also has another 30 or so songs. Some are holiday themed which could be fun if you were expecting guests for a party. It has some public domain tunes from the Baroque & Renaissance period as well as some contemporary tunes like ""Music Box Dancer"". I currently have it on what sounds like a mariachi band playing ""March of the Toreadors"" from Carmen which is kind of hilarious but I can't imagine what maniac would want to be alerted by that in their house ever.

I've used both my phone and my computer as devices with ZERO problems or drops. The sound is freaking AMAZING! I started off with Soundgarden's 'Slaves and Bulldozers' and from the 1st second of that baseline it felt like I was enveloped in sound. I then listened to Lana Del Ray to hear a airy, female voice and the sound was pure and ethereal. You can hear each distinct part of the music. The bass is balanced and not overblown. I use these on my morning walks everyday so now they just play all random stuff. They are comfortable and even if I sweat in them, they wipe clean to a like-new product.

B077NT2JZK,3.0,"The computer itself is fine. It was originally sold to a university in California, and half the warranty had been used while it sat on a shelf. I had to have the warranty put in my name, and that took several days, so I could get it repaired. Still out 1.5 years of warranty! What even! The box was slightly worn, and the cables were dirty even though the box was sealed. I made the mistake of thinking it had a screen protector on it and tried to pull it off. Y'all, it was part of the screen. The seller refunded me the difference in price between a new item and a like new item. Since this already had a registered owner in Dell's system and it was some trouble to transfer over, I'd say it was conceivably like new but not new. I used that difference in price to pay for the repair. [Note: they did initially not want to make up the difference until I provided pictures of dirty cords, etc, and offered to escalate it to Amazon's customer service. But they did eventually grant the refund in difference. But it took weeks to get the difference in price and then to have the warranty transferred to me. I was *this close* to going through Amazon to try to return the whole shebang because of being misled. But they finally came through with a compromise I found acceptable. And I am otherwise happy with the computer.]<br /><br />Here are my thoughts on the machine itself--unrelated to the seller:<br /><br />PROS<br />- Terrific resolution. Much easier to read screen text.<br />- Lots of variety in color configurations for different light environments.<br />- 32 GB of memory really makes a difference over my previous 4-8GB.<br />- SSD is likewise fast and the whole system is quiet.<br />- This list of pros is short, but they are the most important things to me. Everything else is small beans.<br /><br />CONS<br />- It is unbelievable how hard it is to get to the USB ports, etc, on the back! I literally have to use needle-nose pliers to plug or unplug USB devices--and a flashlight and contortions. I've read it's because the speakers didn't leave a lot of options for where to put these, but it just ridiculous.<br />- The sound is not as good as I expected. My last Dell AIO had JBL speakers and I don't think I realized how good those were. To be fair, the sound is fine, I was just expecting to be blown away by the six speakers on the bottom.<br />- Poor webcam placement. It's on the bottom at a really weird angle. Will probably upgrade.<br />- Onboard mic is also worse than what was in the Inspiron 2320. Remedied by purchasing a separate mic. But on a system this expensive, the mic and webcam should be premium, not barely useable.<br />- The screen would buzz softly at anything less than 100% brightness. A workaround is to reduce brightness via Radeon Pro graphics board. SOLUTION: go through Dell community customer service boards to update the VBIOS.<br />- The color temperatures sometimes get really off after the monitor goes to sleep and wakes up. I put a shortcut to Dell Premier Color in the taskbar and just reapply the setting, and it's fine. Still shouldn't even be a thing that happens on a machine with this price tag.<br />- Not a fan of the included wired mouse and keyboard, so I swapped out my own. I'm guessing this was originally meant for a computer lab where you wouldn't want someone to walk away with the peripherals.<br /><br />OVERALL VERDICT<br />It took a while to get everything sorted, some of which was my fault. But I did get it sorted. The lower price from the seller comes with the tradeoff of losing some of the warranty and it taking extra time to get the remaining warranty transferred to me. But it still cost thousands less via this route than it would have otherwise. So worth it, I guess, if you've got the time for shenanigans.",positive,negative

When I'm in a hurry, I usually throw my phone in the holster of the car and start driving... I don't have time to dig out the USB cable and carefully plug it in, it's an extra step that I often decide to skip and just stick with Bluetooth audio instead.<br />This cable changes everything! Now, the cable is magnetically hanging next to the phone already, all I need to do is wave it near the bottom of the phone and CLICK!

B07XV6QYLD,2.0,"This phone A10s is basically the worse version of the old Galaxy S7 Edge from seven years ago. Slightly higher battery capacity - 4000 instead of 3600, same screen size, but the quality of the screen is not as good. S7 screen glass is much better quality, it's smoother and it's scratch resistant.  A10 touch screen response time is worse than S7. There is some kind of a split second lag which feels strange after using S7.<br /><br />Unlike S7, A10 doesn't have wireless charging :(<br /><br />Blue light functionality doesn't work when I flip the blue light button. Button is there but functionality is not. No physical home button anymore.<br /><br />NFC is not supported, can't pay in the store using this phone. Item specs here says ""Connectivity NFC"" which is misleading. Old S7 supports NFC.<br /><br />Sound is HORRIBLE for single built in speaker.  Comparing to old S7 playing the same song this phone is missing low frequencies,  sound is flat and unimpressive, no Dolby. S7 sound has lots of volume,  low and high frequencies and it feels like surround sound, like movie theater experience.<br /><br />Dolby Atmos is disabled on A10 for built in speaker. Adaptive sound functionality is completely missing, nada. When I plug in earphones, Dolby Atmos gets enabled but doesn't make any difference and left ear piece is much more quiet than the right one. The phone doesn't distribute sound equally between the left and right ear pieces.<br /><br />Not possible to opt out from sending Samsung all your phone logs info. All preinstalled apps had rights to mess up phones operation system and access everything on the phone and send your private info everywhere. I had to go through every setting to change that. New icons look ugly.<br /><br />Good features are dual sim and a radio tuner so one can listen to the local FM radio without wi-fi or cell service. It still has a jack for wired ear phones,  the wire is used as an antenna for the radio tuner. Fresh battery holds charge better than a seven years old Galaxy S7 Edge.  It was easy to set up and install applications from Google Play.

B07QF74ZXB,5.0,"What an amazing router at such a great price! I did a lot of research before I bought this. Because my previous router was a TP-Link router also, I was skeptical about this one at first. I was actually leaning towards a $300 Asus gaming router (I don’t game that much, I just wanted something powerful). But truth is, my previous TP-Link was just end of life—almost five years old. I’m pretty certain that WiFi tech was going out. I found an article titled something like “Best 2020 Routers” by Tom’s Guide and this was his #1 ranked router out of 10! After reading some other reviews and resources about it, I pulled the trigger. This router quadrupled my speeds (which wasn’t hard to do I suppose since my previous internet speed was so intermittent and slow).<br /><br />I am extremely satisfied with this router. I’m a lv 4 IT engineer for a big company, and I can tell you that this is a quality product. You are getting the quality of these expensive gaming routers for half or quarter the cost. And the newer admin interface is very easy and simple. The setup for this router was easier than I’ve ever experienced. I have 25-30 wireless connections by the way and this thing is handling it like a champ.

B009S4FMB6,4.0,"Since the [[ASIN:B009S4FMB6 Jabra SUPREME Driver's Edition Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Silver]] comes with a headband, I tend to use it with the headband.  Unfortunately, my hair is thinning because I lose some each time I remove the headset.  Regardless, this bluetooth is extremely easy to synch with my Droid and it's recognized each and every time I turn on the Bluetooth in the car.  I wear this only for driving and I don't care that passersby give me funny looks, it works great.  The earpiece is larger than most contemporary bluetooth devices, but it's cushiony and comfortable for long drives.  The microphone is sensitive and responsive.  I haven't had a complaint yet with any call.  Slipping the earphone onto the headband is a simple task, and I find that I'm wearing it 90% of the time, preferring that to the ear wire and no band.  My main criticism other than the hair pulling of this design is that it takes some getting used to to operate the touch controls as well as turn the device on and off.  When off of the band, it's an easy feat, but no so when it's attached and you can't bend the microphone down completely.  Since the battery is really long lasting, it hasn't run out of power yet in the middle of a call.  Because you have options for charging this set, you're a step ahead, and with an adjustable headband, it fits most head sizes.  It's a good set.",positive,positive

B0948VB4MY,5.0,"Overall rating 4.5, rounded up to 5.  I don't think there's anything better for this price.<br /><br />I wanted a ""better"" set of wireless earbuds for casual music listening: I wanted either AptX HD or LDAC, good battery life, and comfortable to wear for at least an hour or two.  (I specifically ruled out over-the-ear headphones because I can't wear them very long, and ruled out wired earbuds for convenience. To me these are acceptable compromises.)<br /><br />I was considering the Sony WF-1000XM4, but didn't want to pay that much for casual listening. I was also considering the new Soundcore Liberty 4, which on paper seems to be a great product. But I decided to try this ""Liberty 2 Pro Upgraded"" pair to see if was good enough for a lot less money.<br /><br />So far I'm really very pleased: the sound is excellent for all my favorite music genres: classical, country, pop, rock, and latin pop, and after replacing the earpiece flaps and cushions I'm finding them very comfortable to wear as I work at my desk.<br /><br />Important: to get the sound right, I had to do several things. First, I downloaded the Soundcore app, connected the earbuds, set the audio quality to LDAC (in settings).  Then on my Android phone (Pixel), I went to the bluetooth advanced settings (usually hidden under developer options: do a web search for more details), and set the Audio Codec to LDAP, the LDAC quality to 900kbps, and made sure that the other BT settings (such as sample rate, bits per sample) were at the highest for good audio.  Finally, I went back to the Soundcore app and played with the equalizer settings until I had what sounded best to my ears.  The app has a neat little personal-hearing tester, which is worth a try, especially if your ears are getting older.  After all this I had nice clean well-balanced sound.  You might try different EQ settings for different music genres if you like, it does make a difference, but perhaps not huge enough to matter.<br /><br />I've read many grumbles about LDAC, but I wonder if those are based on using the default settings: in my experience getting the settings right makes a very big difference.<br /><br />PS  It seems that the LDAC settings on Android go back to ""best efforts"" everytime the earbuds are disconnected.  Quite annoying: I have to set them back to 900kbps every time. The other settings are stable.",positive,positive
B0993BNN1G,2.0,"The premise with the ENSGO TC7 8” Teleprompter and others like it is to find a lens adapter that fits your camera and then screw it into your camera...  then let your camera hang, by those threads, from the teleprompter.  What??<br /><br />First, the product:  included in the box of the ENSGO TC7 8” Teleprompter is a set of lens adapters for common lens sizes going from 49mm to 82mm.  There's also a bracket for a phone mount along with a couple of foam pieces to use with the phone adapter.  Lastly, a bluetooth remote control for use with teleprompter apps.<br /><br />If one follows the included directions or even use the product images as a guide, this would be the setup: Pick the correct adapter size and screws it to the lens of the camera.  The adapter then slips into a slot in the main body of the product and from there, the tripod is mounted to the teleprompter or the camera.  In either of these mounting scenarios, the thread holding the camera to the adapter is expected to hold the entire weight of the camera or the weight of the teleprompter + tablet.  Please do NOT do this.<br /><br />I use two tripods for this setup.  One for the teleprompter and the other for the camera itself.  I have yet figured out a secure bracket that would allow the camera to mount to the teleprompter without putting pressure on the screw threads.",negative,negative

B013F7OEUG,4.0,"I listen to music all day at work and I also enjoy listening to music at home and as such I spend a lot of time with headphones on my head. This is one of the more unusual headsets I have used, more in terms of their appearance than for their features or quality. These are decent headphones with some very interesting features though the sound profile is a little off, particularly in the highs.<br /><br />I received the blue and yellow headset and these definitely look like headphones for kids. They almost look like toys, though in use they have revealed themselves to be a bit better than toys. The main features they offer are Bluetooth connectivity, FM tuning, direct audio connection via 3.5mm cable and hands-free connectivity.<br /><br />When I received these, they were completely dead and needed to be charged up. It took me a little time to realize they were not broken, but once I plugged them in to charge the problem became very clear. I was then able to work with them. So, if you receive these and cannot get them to work, try plugging them in first.<br /><br />I was able to pair these to my computer and they connected without trouble. The headphones identify themselves as “KB-2600”. When I had them connected to my computer they worked fine and they did not stutter or skip which is all you really can ask for. I did not try testing the range.<br /><br />I discovered, quite by accident, that this headset has a full-blown FM tuner and it can scan for channels and make channel presets. It actually works surprisingly well and I found myself listening to a station coming from 50 miles north and it was surprisingly clear. Most headsets I have used to not have an FM tuner so finding these to have a tuner was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />I loaded up some music and listened very closely to the sound, and unfortunately I found an issue with the sound profile. The bass is good; it is about right, not overdriven and not soft. The midrange is slightly strong but still quite good. The problem is in the highs which sound muddled and flat. When listening to vocals the sound is not particularly sharp, instead sounding far away. It is fixable with an equalizer, but with small music player or phone an equalizer may not be available.<br /><br />Comfort-wise, these are actually more comfortable than their looks would suggest. I personally like a headphone that clamps a little tighter on my ears but these are better than some of the other sets I have used. The pads on each phone is a mildly firm leatherette material that is comfortable and does not heat up as much as one might expect. The headband itself has a very soft pad on it that provides a very nice cushion between itself and the head.<br /><br />These are very interesting headphones and they have some cool features. Except for having a deficiency in the high range, these work well and they are quite comfortable. If you get a two-color unit it is a very good choice for younger listeners.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",positive,positive

B0BF5LKP5Q,5.0,"First thing's first, it is important to understand what you are getting. This isn't a VR headset - you aren't going to be bringing these on a trip to play some beat saber. These are simply a screen that you can strap to your head.<br /><br />Now that we have that out of the way, lets go into the things I love about these. Plugging these into a device is (usually) a breeze and you can get to consuming your content on a virtual screen in no time. The included blackout shade is a great addition, giving you the choice between maintaining situational awareness of your surroundings, or closing yourself off to the world and immersing yourself in the content.<br /><br />I particularly like using these on a plane. It is great to be able to shut out everything that is going on around you and just watching content without your seatmates peeking over to see what you are watching. I do recommend using in-ear headphones since on or over ear types of headphones can get uncomfortable when combined with the glasses.<br /><br />If you wear glasses, I suggest purchasing prescription lens inserts - it will really make your experience just that much better.<br /><br />I think it is really smart that these are powered by whatever device they are plugged into. This allows the device to be less bulky and lighter; hence more comfortable for long term wear. The downside being, your device will consume power quicker. This can be mitigated with a wireless charger (since your glasses are plugged into your device).<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of the iphone adapter solution, but it does work, and I find the experience better on iphone than other devices I have tried (samsung phone, iPad pro, and laptop).",positive,positive

B09FYH2511,5.0,"We've been using an older first generation Portal and like it very much. I was not expecting to be so impressed with this one, but wow have they managed to improve almost everything about the original! It still has the very cool zoom-and-pan style camera feature that follows the subject, as well as all the fun filters and of course my kids' favorite, story time... but the polish and style of this unit is really premium. The speaker is fantastic and LOUD if you want it to be. The clarity and bass rivals my bookshelf speakers so well, sometimes the kids play music off it and I could have sworn they were using the speakers in the living room. But the biggest improvement over the previous generation is the ability to run off battery power and move around. The ""portable portal"" honestly makes so much sense, I wonder why the original stationary style ones came out first!<br />Make no mistake, it is NOT a tablet, it is not thin and won't fit in an attaché case nicely. It is wedge-shaped making it stand easily at an ideal angle, and even has a cut-out handle to pick it up and carry it to a better location for video chat. This is great for bringing it to wherever my kids happen to be congregating currently, and it can be put back up on the shelf when done to charge. Like the original Portals, it has Alexa built in and can act as an Echo for most things, however it is very tied into Facebook's ecosystem. That means that although it seems to run something akin to Android behind the scenes, this is NOT going to offer a standard App store, and even things like Youtube are not available for it (licensing issues with Google I'd suppose). However there is a browser, and you can navigate to YouTube and play it from the website just fine, although a proper app would be much easier to navigate. It does have Plex support, which I found interesting since I have a Plex server. I never thought I'd find Plex available where Youtube is not! Meanwhile, between Youtube in the browser, Amazon Music through Alexa and content on Plex, there are plenty of ways to make it a music streamer on that glorious better-than-it-should-sound speaker. And the camera works just as well if not better than the OG Portal!<br />Calls over FB Messenger or Whatsapp work well, and of course the camera / mic not only have a switch to toggle, but the camera has a physical cover that can slide over the lens in case you don't trust Facebook not to snoop. But that's another story.<br />All things considered, this is a solid product.",positive,positive
B000TG4AGU,1.0,For a $125 this is a complete ripoff.  I bought two pairs of Logitech headphones.  This one and the Logitech ClearChat Comfort/USB Headset H390 ($25).

I have been buying Logitech for over 10 years and I am shocked that they would pull something like this.  Usually with this brand an investment of $125 would have a more noticeable boost in quality.  This item is a complete ripoff.  Buy the $25 pair and you'll come out on top.,negative,negative

B000TMFYAA,5.0,"Although this review may seem to be ""a little late"", I do think that my experience with the earlier model of this Sony is appropriate. I bought a KDS-60A2000 in January of 2007 so I've had it for a few months over a year. As most of you will recognize, my unit is a 60"" SXRT from the previous model year.<br /><br />Like many of you, I did a lot of Internet research before settling on the Sony - it was very highly rated by a number of sites. The final straw was live viewing many sets side-by-side on the same program from the same source - it was a no-brainer - the Sony had at least as good a picture as any Plasma in the store and the price couldn't be beat.<br /><br />I use Verizon's FIOS fiber optic service and have the unit hooked up through my home theater audio. The picture - indeed the HD experience - is simply awesome - especially live sports - like ice hockey.<br /><br />I did ""tune"" the picture using the DVE (Digital Video Essentials) HD optimization DVD and it remains the sharpest, most accurate picture that I have personally seen (including the high-bucks plasma sets). I've had absolutely no problems of any kind and there have been no regrets on purchasing this set.<br /><br />Another tidbit: I also purchased a Logitech Harmony 880 remote control and am able to control the Sony, the Verizon HD receiver, a Yamaha home theater receiver and a Sony upscaling DVD with a single click. It's programmed via the Logitech Internet site (using a USB connection) and can handle about any peripheral you might have. I've got a bowlful of unused remotes now. It's a little pricey at $150 but it has contributed to my HD enjoyment by simplifying the mechanics.",positive,positive
B001OTZ8DA,5.0,"Nice Quality.  Definitely an improvement over what  I have been using.  $1350+ worth?  Meh....  I wish there was more metal in the headband so I knew it wasn't going to break.  I wish the audio cable could plug into either left side or right side and that it was one sided removable for ergodynamics.  I wish instead of a  coffin box that it came in, that it came with a nice armored carrying case with a caribiner.  To bad it didn't have a slide mechanism so that I could experience closed air vs open air.  Sometimes where you might wear these things could get noisy outside and you don't want that to encroach on the sound.  They are comfortable.  I have heard things in music I haven't heard before or I can hear it more clearly, it's like listening for the first time, gives you that thrill back again.  Great sound as promised.

B07WMTLW2R,5.0,"I am a graphic designer and web developer on a budget and this Acer CB272 bmiprx 27"" Full HD Monitor is a great addition to my home office where I do the majority of my creative work.<br /><br />I have another large monitor connected to my MB Pro using an HDMI cable, but I have experienced issues with Photoshop unless my displays mirrored. This monitor has a VGA connection, and I believe that is the reason I can use this independently as a secondary display without my images blacking out. This monitor has 1 x Display Port, 1 x HDMI, 1 x VGA, 1 x Audio-in, 1 x Audio-out. VGA and audio cables are included,<br /><br />This frameless widescreen monitor has a small footprint and can pivot vertically. I think that's pretty nifty since I have never owned a monitor that could do that before. The screen height is adjustable to 4.7"", with a tilt angle of -5° to 20°, and 360° swivel for perfect viewing without fade I can adjust my screen when I adjust my position or change places.<br /><br />So far I have not experienced any light bleed along the edges and I will update this review if that happens over time.<br /><br />You don't have to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a high-quality display. Been there, done that and won't do it again because technology becomes much better and cheaper over time. I splurged on a twelve hundred dollar display several years ago and this monitor offers excellent image quality at a much more affordable price.<br /><br />My professional recommendation is... buy this monitor and go have fun with all the money you've saved.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

So many features ! I like having an FM radio to use in the house now ! It’s been years since Iv had a working FM radio in our home . It really exceeded my expectations . The speakers could be a better quality but for an alarm clock it’s not bad . It’s better than the iPhone speakers for sure . Sometimes I listen to books and my daughter likes to listen with me and my iPhone just us t that loud . This made it so we both could hear the book being read . I am Very pleased with this clock . It’s a good design . I know my son wants one for his room now that he’s seen how cool it is . We really rely on our cell<br />Phone alarms more than anything but now we have this and it’s kinda like our backup in case my alarm fails for some reason . It’s happened before and was a disaster .

B000066R6M,5.0,"I don't usually purchase products that require earbuds because I have considerable hearing loss. However, I took a chance on this little radio and I am VERY glad I did. I can hear this radio extremely well -- it has a tremendous amount of volume power considering its size (4"" long, about the size of a cell phone). It has AM & FM bands, stereo/mono setting, can be used w/out the earbuds as a regular radio. It also allows memory pre-sets of your favorite stations. The radio attaches to your belt via a removable plastic clip.<br /><br />If you use hearing aids,you will need to remove them to use the earbuds, of course. I suppose you could try a different headset device -- one that can be used WITH hearing aids. I have found that I can hear this radio very well with the use of the earbuds. Again, my hearing loss is severe-to-profound, but I can hear this baby!<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this radio for use with or without any type of headest.

My ears are small and most earbuds hurt within minutes, but I have one really inexpensive set that works ok, but if I'm outside working in the horse barn, they can get sweaty and slippery. These are far better than I expected.<br /><br />They come with three different size ear bud attachments so you can get the right fit - the smallest set fits me well and they don't pinch or hurt even after an hour of wearing them. The over ear hook isn't hard and it's thin enough to fit over each ear love when with my glasses on. I work with horses and the associated barn chores so that means sweat and lots of movement which can be a problem with earbuds. These have impressed me.

B0087T1S6G,3.0,"Picked this up on the gold box deal. Moved from my 25$ a month plan on my LG Optimus V to this one.<br /><br />In hindsight, while I am not entirely happy with the phone, it is a step up and I kind of don't regret losing the cheaper plan I was grandfathered in on.<br /><br />Pros!<br />Battery life is pretty nice.<br />Screen is bright, looks great.<br />TONS of room to install apps. As I mentioned above, my old phone was an LG Optimus and had a whopping 200~ megs to install them.<br />Beats Audio is actually pretty nice.<br /><br />Cons!<br />Worst wifi I have ever used in my life. My touchpad, android tablet, old LG phone, etc all got 2-3 signal bars out of 3 while in my house. I barely even get the first little dot indicator on this one.<br />Not exactly a thorough instruction manual (moving from 2.2 to 4.0 is fairly different).<br />Phones shape is just, odd to me. It's not flat, and that little bar at the bottom pokes out strangely to me. That being said, I didn't take off any stars from the review for design issues.

BRIGHT LED flash lights up the subjects but also washes out the photos.<br />Worse/slower data than my old LG on the same network.<br /><br />Basically, as I mentioned before, while I don't entirely regret losing my 25$ monthly plan and moving off my old LG, paying 10$ a month more for literally the same thing stings a bit when I don't like the reason I moved that much. It's a great phone, but there are some fairly strong cons to me about it, the major one being the weak wifi signal.<br /><br />Still, it cost me 50$ on the gold box deal, so if you can find it for around 50-60 and are upgrading from an older phone model, it's probably worth it. I would not, however, pay MSRP for this thing or anywhere near it.<br /><br />Virgin Mobile does have some awesome reps though, and when I called in to transfer my phone (mid month, and I wanted to see if I could keep my old month or if I had to start a new one), they peeked at the call record and saw I had only used ~20 minutes. Had me swapped out and going in about 5 minutes and the phone was working for texts in about 10 mins.<br /><br />4 stars for virgin mobile, 3 for the phone.

I bought a briefcase-style case which does fit, and that one has room for my Fire too, but not much else fits into it except the charging cables. This one is different. Not only is there plenty of room for (in addition to the tablet, phone, wallet, and glasses) noise-canceling headphones and snacks, but cables, a camera, a sweater, your personal travel pharmacy, a magazine or two, and more. In fact, if you're just going somewhere overnight, this might be all you need. There are many well-crafted pockets, all accessible from both inside and out. The padded backpack straps are strong and comfortable.  There's also a handle on top and a wide strap along the back so you can slip it onto your wheeled bag for those dashes across airports between planes. Wonderful backpack for business travelers, writers, or anyone who can't do without their electronics.",positive,positive

B07BRM55KC,1.0,"The sound quality is muffled as though you are under water. The headphones feel a little bit sick and bulky around the ears and the headband is non-adjustable, so I'm me it's it's a little wide. There is no noise cancellation as you can hear everything in the environment around you and the sound from the headphones seems to diminish overtime in comparison to your environment. There is no volume adjustment control only a stop-start button on the microphone attachment. Does down my microphone attachment does not work (tried it on my phone & game controller).  The only Advantage is that you don't have to use Bluetooth, everything else about these headphones is trash!",negative,negative
B07SMSW7MP,2.0,"So, I have this backpack, and it is kinda weird. You have to see my pictures as it is a different style than what is pictured in the description. I don't really care for it as it is awkward to handle.<br /><br />--It is a basic looking back pack. I like the bright orange in contrast to the black. That is likely the only feature I really like.<br />--The bag is deep. It measures roughly 21"" long, this includes the top portion being unfolded, as that is usable space if need be. @17"" wide<br />--The access to the main compartment is a velcro closure with adjustable hook straps for added security (and to keep added length folded down). Unlike many backpacks, there is just one slit opening across the top with velcro to close. Most backpacks have a zipper closure, as well as going a bit down the sides, for ease of access. I'm not fond of how my bag is styled in that way.<br />--Inside the great nylon cavern of the main compartment, it splits into several more compartments and pockets, including a lightly padded pocket.<br />--exterior pockets included two open side pockets that would be great to stick a water bottle in or an umbrella.<br />--two good sized compartments on the front- one zippered, one velcro flap closure.<br />--one rear zip pocket, as well as what appears to be a pass through strap of material- perhaps for use on a luggage handle?<br />--padded shoulder straps are comfortable. Straps include d-rings for clipping keys, or whatever to.<br />--overall feel is good<br />-I cant for the life of me find the USB port that it claims to have. I don't see anywhere for headphones, etc.. so I don't know what is going on.<br /><br />The part that makes me really not like it is the main opening. First, it is deep, which can be good or bad depending on your needs. But, the top folds over way to easily. So it takes some major rooting around to find stuff, and the flap wants to fold down, and if it manages to fold down, it is easily closed tight by the velcro. This is super annoying if you want to get into and out of the bag repeatedly. I'm just like STAY OPEN. If it zipped, it would be better, then at least if it folder over it would be easy enough to get it, but with the velcro closing it up, it is irritating.<br /><br />The other aspect that I dont care for is the hooks on the front. Well, they are anchored on the front, but since they are used to help keep bag closed (in addition to the velcro), when they aren't hooked, they are dangling down the front. So you have those kicking around in the front, and the shoulder straps and all its extras kicking around in the back. It isn't as clean or stream lined as it could be. It feels frumpy, I am sorry to say. I was hoping to replace my every day carry bag- I like to have a little cross body purse, plus a back pack for all my additional daily needs. This might get old quick as I try to get used to the odd features.",negative,negative

B08NF2NVV5,3.0,"I have an HP laptop I want to use in the field for running an all-day event stream without needing to tether to a wall. I thought something like this would be a good move to keep it charged since the battery only lasts about 2.5 hours running the stream (it's CPU intensive). However, this laptop does not support USB-C PD charging unfortunately (I was hoping it did, there is a USB-C port, but sadly only output is supported), so I had to resort to using the AC part. Now, I know converting DC from a battery to AC requires quite a bit of power loss, but one recharge of my laptop from single digits to 80% practically wiped the power supply out. I definitely would not be able to charge the laptop more than once off of this, and I have my doubts it would even make it all the way to 100% without dying honestly. I was really hoping it would last longer. If you have a PD-compatible laptop, this might work better for you. I DO love that it has an AC outlet for emergencies, and I'll probably take this with us camping because it is pretty cool to have. But the product description implies this is a good option for charging a laptop, but for the price I've seen better options I think. At the very least, I wish this had a automotive-style 12v DC port so I could try getting that kind of charger for my laptop (less power lost since not inverting to AC), but alas. The only real laptop charging options are AC and USB-C/PD, and if your laptop doesn't use the latter, the first is a pretty inefficient option.",positive,negative
B08KDDHLQ5,5.0,"This is my second set of neckband speaker I have. I listen to music a lot, pretty much all the time especially when I am at work. Thankfully the environment allows me to use this neckband speakers to listen to music that way. It is actually safer to do that than having headsets on which can isolate you and could prevent you from realizing what is going on around you. That is why I like using these types of speakers or bone conducting headsets, so I can still hear what is going on around me.<br /><br />This one in comparison to my other one especially is a lot lighter, I barely notice that it is there really. It is not as flexible as my other one but it forms nicely around my neck and really works and fits well that way. It has just the right amount of buttons that allows me to blindly control it without having to take out my phone to move onto the next song, change the volume, pause the music in case I have to talk to someone and really do anything I need to.<br /><br />The sound quality is very nice and you can really get a good volume going with this so no worry, you will still have plenty of volume if you want to blast music into your ears. It is very easy to use and to connect to your phone. I have a Samsung S20 and had no issues at all. I get about 7 hours or so of music which gives me about a work day worth of music and charging doesn’t take that long. My other one does have more staying power and does charge a bit faster, but by having these two I can now alternate, while one is charging I can use the other one. Very happy with this one but if anything changes I will update my review.",positive,positive
B09BHZVPK4,5.0,"I have tested and reviewed literally hundreds of Bluetooth speakers and while I am not a fan of music that is particularly bass heavy I found this speaker produces rich, vibrant sounds from all wave lengths.  It produces more than ample volume for most any setting and has several connection methods.<br /><br />While I have tested and reviewed Bluetooth speakers costing far more than what this does, the sound quality from this speaker rivals them.  In relation to the sound quality this speaker is simply incredible.<br /><br />In regards to charging time and battery life, both are outstanding.  In my tests charging takes about approximately 3 hours to charge the built in 5,000 mAh battery and the speaker lasts a solid 4.5 hours at max volume - 12 hour with volume midway (of course this will vary a bit due to exact settings).<br /><br />There are multiple ways to connect to this speaker including Bluetooth 5.0, which can reach much further than previous versions, through an AUX cable, a 3.5mm jack, SD card and you can even connect via NFC (Near Field Communication).<br /><br />I have taken this speaker with me to the pool for the last couple of months and have been thoroughly impressed with its performance.  The battery, being 5,000 mAh, it’s much longer lasting than most allowing for all day listening and the sound quality has been outstanding.<br /><br />This speaker is rated IPX4 meaning it is tested and proven safe for splashes - technically, a device with a level 4 water resistance rating can survive small water jets projected by a 6.3mm nozzle at any angle.<br /><br />If you have 2 of these speakers they pair for true surround sound producing a full, rich, encompassing sound environment that is hard to believe can come from a pair of small Bluetooth speakers.  I have the larger version of this speaker and pair the two together outside by our pool for a really amazing sound quality.<br /><br />This battery and speaker comes with a bit of weight - 2.31 pounds to be exact, far less than the larger version but still heavier than most Bluetooth speakers.<br /><br />This is an all around great Bluetooth speaker that I certainly recommend.",positive,positive

B07KRY43KN,5.0,"I am not the target demographic for this device: middle-aged empty nester who loves to watch sci-fi, thrillers, and horror. I have a number of these brilliantly simple, highly configurable lights. They are perfect in the bedroom where, depending on our intended mood, a variety of different colors or modes might be appropriate. I have two in the living room, hiding behind tropical plants at a 3' height, on either side of the big screen, about 5 feet away on each side. I have a routine set up to turn off all the lights in the room and engage campfire mode in both lights at 45% brightness with a single keyword. Voila--instant torchlight in the jungle (or romantic candlelight - take your pick). I am a colossal LOST fan, and this lighting is perfect for watching LOST, or anything scary or dark. And if I need a different effect, that's only a few words away.<br /><br />The simplicity with which these set up and configure themselves is so good it makes Apple products jealous. If you have an Alexa on your Wi-Fi network, simply plug the Glow in to a power source, open the Alexa app on your phone, and the light will auto-connect to your network and add itself to Alexa. It will then prompt you to configure it with a name and add it to any groups, etc. Utterly simple. If the setup fails, it might ask you to scan the barcode on the back of the booklet it came with to get it going, but this has not been my experience - they have all self-configured and join the network seamlessly.<br /><br />For those of you complaining this does not have a mic and speaker - folks, it works WITH an Echo device. It is a light - that's it. If Amazon built Alexa mics and speakers into this it would cost double--and I am positive they are developing just such a light ...for which you will pay $60+.<br /><br />Normally, these are $30/ea, but they were 45% off on Prime Day, so I added a few more.  There are indeed cheaper (and much more expensive) smart mood lights on the market, but if you run Alexa at home, this is hands down the best way to do it. Seamless.<br /><br />It baffles me that Amazon does not have a whole range of lighting products which work exactly like this. They easily could. Give me one of these on a larger scale (12-15"") and make it weatherproof for outside on the patio, please.",positive,negative
B08M16HKV9,4.0,"This is a good sound bar for a tv that is lacking sound. If you have a tv that already produces a loud enough sound that you can hear it well- this probably isn't for you as it won't fill the room with sound like a giant surround sound system and it really doesn't compliment a tv with already good speakers. But if you want this just to music in the kitchen or for a smaller tv, yeah it'd work great for that! I got it for a big tv that I could already hear on though and thought it would add some ""boom"" factor like a theater but was severely mistaken. Apparently that's just all sound bars as I've tried multiple ones now. They won't give you a theater booming sound or surround sound at all...

B07DMT42MN,5.0,"The VModa Crossfade 2 Wireless Headphones are great! I love the color (matte white and chrome), which I consider to be neutral or unisex. They look sleek and modern. The packaging is a lot smaller than another pair that I have.  They fold up nicely which makes them small and compact. They fit nicely into a carrying case. They are easy to set-up, wireless (although they come with an aux cord) and Bluetooth enabled. Charging the headphones is pretty easy (usb cord), and the battery life is great. More importantly, the sound quality is good. You can control the volume easily on the ears of the headset. The mic picks up sound well. The ear muffs are comfortable, not too loose or too tight. The sound is clear, sharp and does not bleed out. They are not too bass heavy.  And while some may frown at the price, I think the quality of these are better than Beats and Bose, but comparable to Sennheiser. My kids and husband each have an older pair of VModa’s, so I can attest to the quality and durability of this brand. They are made to last, so I expect several years of quality listening and enjoyment. I’d definitely recommend these.",positive,positive
B0BRMXMNR3,5.0,The monitor looks great & is very portable. I don't game so I'm not an expert on lag but I don't notice any in day to day use.

B0753P1GTS,5.0,"I have worked with a number of trackballs, my most successful being a Logitech M570 which served me well for years. I finally wore it out and after some research I purchased the Logitech MX Ergo to replace it. I have had it about three days, and it has already proven to be exactly what I had hoped and more. It’s not perfect but it’s close.<br /><br />I was attracted to the fact that it works both as a wireless mouse with a USB receiver as well as a Bluetooth mouse. I have two computers on my desk, one being a Windows 10 system and the other being a Linux (Arch-based) system. My old trackball worked with both though I had to move the receiver between the systems, so I went with the assumption that this one would also work with both.<br /><br />I connected the trackball to my Windows system via Bluetooth and it has been flawless in operation. It connects without intervention and it works exactly as expected - all buttons work as they should and the operation is very smooth and predictable.<br /><br />I plugged the USB receiver into the Linux machine, pushed the channel button on the trackball and it immediately started working on the Linux machine, even though it was still paired to the Windows system via Bluetooth. It works exactly as it should and I have had absolutely no issues with the trackball on my Linux installation. So now, I can switch back and forth between the two systems with the push of the channel button and without having to connect or disconnect anything. It simply works, and the switch-over is fast. The take-away for me is that I no longer need two mice on the desk.<br /><br />I friend came over with his MacBook and there was no issue at all with connecting the trackball via USB. We did not try connecting via Bluetooth.<br /><br />The trackball has a metal plate on the bottom that is held in place with magnets, and depending on how the plate is attached the trackball can be tilted to ease wrist strain. The plate serves another purpose too - it adds a lot of weight to the trackball. Even without the plate, the trackball is hefty and has some mass to it, but the plate just makes it even more so. For me that’s a positive; others may dislike the added weight.<br /><br />One of the things I have missed has been a tilting scroll wheel. This trackball has one and I have been enjoying getting used to that feature again.<br /><br />One thing I did notice is that there is no CD/DVD in the package for loading drivers. This isn’t a big deal, and it’s easy enough to get the drivers from the net. That said, the trackball just seems to work when you attach it, without any issue. For me it has absolutely been plug-and-play, on every system I have tried.<br /><br />If I could change one thing - I would have made this trackball a little bigger. I have big hands and I struggle to find a trackball that’s an absolute perfect fit. This one is close. For the large majority of people it’s going to be spot on.<br /><br />I am very happy with this trackball and have no issue with recommending it. It works great, connects easily, when connected to two different systems it switches at the press of a button, it has a bit of heft to it and the tilt is adjustable for wrist comfort. It’s really all I could ask for.",positive,positive

B0877BPCJM,5.0,"Replacing my altec lansing speakers from the early 2000's. Honestly, I'm not an audiophile. My altec speakers were pretty good speakers too, and I can't tell the difference. My upgrade is simply cosmetics. This logitech set is black and sleek, looks more modern. My altec speakers were grayish, very early 2000's design.<br /><br />I like the nifty wireless controller that looks like a little echo dot, but it's smaller. So coming from speakers in the early 2000's, my first question was.. Can this function like old school speakers if I don't care for all the tech? So I simply used the 3.5mm connection method from my dell to the logitech, but there was NO SOUND. So you have to at least power up the wireless controller for the first time. Because under the controller is a button to switch from bluetooth to wired. Press the WIRE option, and you will then get audio. After this, if you remove the batteries and take away the wireless controller, the speakers will continue to work as 3.5mm connected speaker. You just have to turn on the wireless controller on the initial set-up. So this is good. My concern was what if the wireless controller is lost or damaged? If that happens, then you would like the speakers to go on like old school speakers connected simply by 3.5mm. So I'm happy to report, this will function without the wireless controller module. I'm not even sure turning on the wireless controller in the initial set-up is absolutely required. Your PC my pick-up sound the moment you plug in the 3.5mm jack. For me, I had to turn on the wireless controller during the initial set-up.<br /><br />Another thing I wondered is if I connect a bluetooth device, say my smartphone, to these speakers, then disconnect, will the speakers automatically revert back to wired? The answer is no. To connect to a bluetooth device, you have to press the bluetooth pairing button under the wireless controller, and it will stay in this mode even after you disconnect. You have to press the ""wire"" button to get back to 3.5mm.<br /><br />One more thing, the left and right speakers have 2 slots in the back to insert the stand. So you can configure it to stand vertically or horizontally. Conclusion... I love the sound, the sleek design and the technology. 5-Stars.",positive,negative

B08GLPZNJJ,1.0,"Edit:  just over one month in, the right earbud stopped working.<br /><br />There are many, many true wireless earbuds out there.  What attracted me to these were the features that they boasted:  Wireless Charging, Active Noise-Cancelling, and bluetooth 5.1.  So how does these earbuds compare to some of the cheaper offerings and does it justify being twice as expensive as some of them?<br /><br />In terms of price, these earbuds can be considered cheap.  Comparable to the mid-tier brands out there such as Anker and MPow, and much, much cheaper than Bose and Jabra brands.  Still, there are many that cost half the price.<br /><br />With the pricing in mind, let's look at the good of these earbuds:<br />+ Long battery life -- I'm on my fourth hour of listening to an audiobook and the battery is still showing 50% on my phone.<br />+ Battery status reporting to phone -- I'm sure most of the recent bluetooth headphones and earbuds do this now, but it is still nice.<br />+ Type-C port for charging -- The move to type-c as the standard charging port for all devices is happening and I'm glad NANNIO didn't cheap out and use a micro-usb.  One less cable to worry about.<br />+ No app necessary --  The passthrough and ANC features can be turned on by tapping the touch controls twice.<br />+ Google Assistant Support -- Tap three times and Google Assistant launches.<br />+ No ugly microphone stick -- The tear-drop shape of these buds look much better than the ugly sticks that Apple's products have, in my opinion.<br />+ Smooth transition between left-only, right-only, and stereo --  These earbuds allow one to choose to use only one earbud while keeping the other in the charger without having to pair the other piece separately.  It's something that I take advantage of on long drives.  I keep one bud in the ear to listen to my audiobook and switch out when the battery runs out.<br /><br />The bad:<br /> - Not low profile -- The Anker SoundCores is pretty inconspicuous in the ear, but these NANNIOs, being white and  sticking out more are anything but low profile.<br /> - ANC not very effective -- The ANC levels are adjusted to be pretty minimal on these buds so while it is possible to hear the difference between the feature being on and off, it is also noticeable that only the lowest hums are cancelled out.  Earbuds simply aren't good for ANC.  Buds simply don't fit perfectly in the ear canal and when the jaw moves, the fit shifts.  By this fact, there is always sound leaking through, reducing the efficiency of any ANC system.  In earbuds, ANC is really just a gimmick.<br /> - Passthrough needs to have wind noise reduction -- The reason for passthrough, in my mind, is to be able to hear surrounding sounds if wearing earbuds while running.  It uses the microphone on the earbuds to pass external sounds through, but when running, there will always be wind noise.  Without wind noise reduction, it makes this feature useless.  I don't know of any earbuds that have addressed this issue.<br /><br />So why did I still give these buds 5-stars?  Because it is priced perfectly for what it is and what it promises.  It has more features and quality that makes it better than the lower  $30 dollar earbuds, but isn't a brand that can demand over $100.  The features that are promised are delivered and any shortcomings are expected, as described above.  With these buds, I get",negative,positive

My Grandmother can see the screen clearly and hold it in her lap, and the ability to view a slideshow without turning the pages of an album is a plus for her limited mobility.

B001CF6B32,5.0,"This is the most amazingly satisfying electronics product I have ever bought. The features are many and easy to learn. I especially enjoy some of the audio and video adjustment features:<br />Audio: DRC setting helps bring up quieter sounds while controlling loud peaks. Great for taming those annoying audio surges in 'background' music or battle scenes, etc. The Dialog feature lets you adjust the dialog perception so that you can hear the voices better over the background sounds in the soundtracks.<br />Video: You can adjust the Sharpness, Brightness, Contrast, Gamma, Hue, Chroma Level and BNR (block noise reduction). Each one has several levels to choose from and you get to sample it as it adjusts, so you can skip back and forth and compare the difference before you decide what to settle on.<br />The USB mode has great, easy to navigate menus. You can also record to your thumb drive from a CD that you are playing. There is a choice of different bit rates to do this and you can record individual tracks or all tracks. Very user-friendly menus for all these choices.<br />This unit has too many features to list, especially for someone like me, who is not quite fluent in tech terminology. Suffice it to say that it performs all the functions beautifully, the manual is very user-friendly and not only tells you how to adjust/change the various settings, but also explains the technical terminology in real English, so you know what those settings actually do when activated.<br />I do love the region-free feature too. But for me, this is more ho-hum, since I already owned one - a far inferior quality Philips one.<br />About the only thing I can think of to improve the user-friendliness of this product would be to have an alphabetized index in the manual. But, since it's only a 61 page manual, it's not such a big issue overall.<br />Another suggestion I would have would be to allow it to record audio from DVDs also. So often, the audio track on a DVD sounds so much better than the soundtrack that is published on CD (i.e.: Brassed Off, Eyes Wide Shut), although I recognize there may be some copyright issues with that concept.<br />For the record: I am getting a second unit for my upstairs TV. Have I mentioned that I love it...? This is a really great product!!!",positive,positive

B0778PCW73,5.0,"I normally think of storage media and batteries when I think of Maxell. That said, this is my second pair of Maxell headphones. My first pair is an ANC set that isn’t perfect, but they’re far and away better than I would ever have expected. These phones are not ANC phones, they’re just wireless listening phones. I was hopeful that they would be as good as my ANC phones in terms of sound quality, and Maxell has not disappointed me. They’re not perfect but they’re better than you can reasonably expect from the asking price.<br /><br />Up front, let me say that I am not a big fan of on-ear headphones, and these fall into that category. I prefer an over-the-ear phone which to me is more comfortable. These aren’t bad for on-ear phones. This comes down to preference. If you are cool with on-ear phones, these will work for you, but if you have to have over-ear phones then you should consider other options.<br /><br />The pads are soft enough, though they aren’t super cushy like some others I have used.<br /><br />Being Bluetooth phones I immediately connected them to my phone. The connection went off without a hitch, though the phone was slower to find these than I had hoped. Once connected, they have been stable and reconnecting is much faster.<br /><br />The real test is the sound profile. On my ANC phones, Maxell worked a miracle and got the sound profile nearly perfect even when the noise canceling is turned on. With these phones, the sound profile is not precise but it’s very balanced and better than average. The bass is strong but not throbbing like most headphones made these days. I like bass, but I don’t appreciate the insistence on pumping it so heavily that it gives me a headache. The midrange is full and music sounds like it has some depth without sounding like it’s playing from the bottom of a well. The highs are bright and clear, though on specific frequency ranges there is the slightest hint of distortion if you really look for it (and since I’m reviewing these, I went looking for it).<br /><br />I cranked up the music as high as I could, and there was only a hint of distortion in the highs. And I had a headache when I was done.<br /><br />Build-wise, these are not too bad. I would not pack them in a gym bag or anything like that, but these should work fine for a long while as long as they’re cared for properly. There’s enough flex in them to make them durable enough to survive some rough handling, but at the end of the day they’re primarily plastic - a drop from the right height or being crushed in a book bag will break them.<br /><br />These phones are under $50 as I write this. What’s really distressing is that I have phones that are north of $200 that do not sound as good as these. Maxell knows how to make a good headphone that competes well with more expensive phones - I have two very different pairs to prove it. It begs the question - why are they only making budget headphones?<br /><br />I would rate these slightly lower if the asking price were above the $50 mark. But, at the asking price you’d be hard-pressed to find headphones that sound better.",positive,positive
B004N09OEG,5.0,"This is my second Condition 1 case that I've tried out for my photo/video gear. The last one was beige colored, but otherwise pretty much identical to this one. So my review of it should be the same- the foam cut outs are easy to tear and conform to things like cameras, lenses, microphones, and other goodies you want to keep safe. It is tough and rugged feeling, however I hope I never have to test the water proof part.<br />While this one came fine, the other Condition 1 case I got had a loose rubber lining that wasn't in the groove etched along the cover. I was able to push it back in and it's been fine there ever since, but I don't know how waterproof that really is if it ever gets dislodged again in the future. So, don't take these swimming with you, however I'd personally trust it to the elements like rain.<br />A good case otherwise.

B07NRYDDKZ,4.0,"I'm somewhat particular about my music and my headphones and have specific things I look for. I'll try to touch on those items in this review.<br /><br />Sound Quality: obviously most important. I look for solid bass (not boomy or hyped). And clear trebles (not sizzling or hyped). These headphones performed okay on both counts although it did seem the bass was a little hyped. I have some expensive headphones that these did not compare favorably to. I also look for general clarity in vocals... here, they did good... nothing nasally or buried in the mix. The exception came when turning on the noise reduction circuit. More on that later.<br /><br />Comfort: okay, I have a big head (size xxl hat). So comfort is important to me. These headphones are adequate in that regard. I had to extend them fully, but at full extension they fit me properly and comfortably, sealing off around the ear. They did not completely surround my ears as some studio monitors do, but they did cover my ears. The padding is decent and I was able to listen for a reasonable amount of time before they became uncomfortable pressing on the perimeter of my ear. If your head/ears are smaller, my guess is they'd be plenty comfortable.<br /><br />Noise reduction: I'm not used to using this feature and wasn't sure how to test it, so I simply sat down next to an air cleaner I have in my home and tried turning noise reduction on and off to see what happened. There was definitely a reduction in the noise... mainly in the lower frequencies. It didnt completely eliminate the sound of the blowing air, but what was left was a thinned out version of the original noise. It was definitely an improvement in the level of noise. The only thing I didnt care for was that there seemed to be an impact on the sound of the music also. Again, the noise reduction thinned the music and left it a little nasally.<br /><br />Controls: straight forward controls. Theres a slider to turn noise reduction on and off and an adjacent button to activate the phone function. Since the phone button was just below the slider, I kept accidentally turning on the phone when trying to activate the noise reduction. Better button placement would have helped.<br /><br />Overall, I was reasonably impressed with these headphones. Especially considering the price, they seem to do well. They come with a nice, soft sided carry case and needed cables. I expect I'll get some good use from these.",positive,negative

And my daughter likes the extra pencil stand (the round hole) in the top corner.<br />But I'm not sure how much, if any protection, this case would provide (lets say if the ipad were dropped, for example). The case itself is made out of a thinner plastic. I'm also not in love with how the case folds opens. After three weeks of opening and closing the case, it still feels awkward and weird.... I simply can't get used to it. But the thing I like the least about the case is it has a shiny texture.

B001IZYV3S,4.0,"I'm not going to compare these speakers with my Aperions, I'm going to compare them with my old pair of HK speakers that they replaced, and with other decent pc speakers we have in the house.  I have to say that I'm a bit surprised by the other reviews -- judging by what I consider appropriate standards, these are really excellent speakers, with clear bright sound, reasonable bass (for their size), and surprisingly good stereo separation.  Much better than the others I mentioned -- so much better that I was honestly impressed.<br /><br />Whether they are worth $80 is more a matter of personal choice than anything else.  I haven't compared a range of speakers between $50 and $100 to see if you get a lot more for a bit more money, or almost as good for a bit less money.

B004NCSNXM,5.0,"I purchased these based on the shorter [[ASIN:B00FC4Z842 Hosa HSS-010X2 Pro Dual Cable]] set that came bundled with a keyboard that I purchased.<br /><br />The construction is excellent in all respects. As a point of comparison to Monster, I also own a set of [[ASIN:B001UAM2ZU Monster StudioLink Interconnects - 2 Meters - 1/4-Inch to 1/4-Inch]], which are much more expensive inch for inch, and these are their equal in both construction and noise-free performance.  I've used these to connect the L and R outputs to a mixer, and I also have used them as L and R out to a pair of small powered speakers from my Soundcraft Ui12 Digital Mixer with Wi-Fi Router and they worked equally well in that role.<br /><br />They are siamesed together, but ou can easily separate them if you need two separate cables to run to separate speakers (if you use them in that way.) Or you can leave them as are to keep your cable runs cleaner. If you do decide to keep them as are I highly recommend that you tape the places where the pairs split because they are very easy to peel back and separate.<br /><br />Basically, if you want a high quality set of interconnect cables for stereo that take 1/4 inch connections these are well worth considering.",positive,positive

B0723599RQ,5.0,"WARNING: THIS IS A LONG REVIEW, BUT I MAY HAVE SOME ANGLES ON THIS OTHERS DON'T :-)<br /><br />Wow. I really like this modem. This is a barebones rock solid dead simple workhorse.<br /><br /> It's got a plug for the cable and one ethernet (RJ-45) port out and I think an on/off switch.<br />That's it. It makes a connection. And hasn't failed since I got it a month or so ago.<br /><br />All I had to do was call my ISP and give them the MAC address (on the sticker on the device)<br />and they updated their tables and that was it. Turn it on. It goes through the startup cycle. Takes a few minutes to connect like they all do and that's it. Set it and forget it.<br /><br />What prompted me to get it, is I don't like having to rent the modem from the ISP @ $10.00/mo forever. This literally pays for itself in 16 months, and most people will have their Internet connection for many times that long, and time flies. So it's a good investment.<br /><br />It doesn't have phone connection like the ISP's modem did. So I called the company/provider that owns copper phone lines in the area and ordered landline service. I'm a nerd/techie and don't care what people say about landlines being for old fogeys, it's like having a backup generator ... I know I can use that landline if the power goes out or if the cell tower gets overwhelmed (too many calls or cell traffic at once), or there's radio interference in the area. Technically cable phone is a 'land line' (hardwired cable connection to provider) and the battery backup in the modem (which the ISP charges more for), could give you emergency phone service in an outage, but a cable phone connection can (and does) fail for more reasons than copper wire phone service does.  (Those copper wire connections are called POTS  - which stands for Plain Old Telephone Service), and copper wire phones are the most reliable.<br /><br />Having a separate modem from a router is optima for a few of reasons... Generally hybrid units of anything do everything okay, but nothing  optimally (for example combination modem-router units like my ISP rents out). Better to keep the modem separate from the router.  Then you can swap either out independently to upgrade as needed, disrupting less of your own network configuration doing so, and also help avoid a single point of failure. Plus, you might be able to score a router in a pinch on shorter notice than a cable modem if the router is the component that fails. Then you can choose the router you actually like, for whatever reason, and don't have to settle for whatever bundling du jour your ISP decides is right for you (even if it isn't).<br /><br />That gets me to the other point. What DID the ISP decide was right for me (but wasn't)?<br /><br />For awhile my ISP modem connection was dropping briefly in the middle of the morning. My computer came back up connected to the ISP's 'general public' wi-fi connection to their router which did not work for me and I'd have to keep manually switching back to my own internal Wi-Fi LAN (network). That was not only inconvenient but it forced me to investigate was was going on there.<br /><br />I learned my ISP gives lets passersby connect to their rental-modem's Wi-Fi signal, without giving me any way to disable that service! That really pissed me off to learn.  The idea is that people driving around who have accounts with the provider can get internet access around the neighborhoods. If I was a passerby, that could really help me, so at first glance maybe 'why not, be a good samaritan'.<br /><br />But wait! There may be more too it than that.<br /><br />Besides the fact that I don't like it (for good reason), they give me no control over that 'feature'!<br />And I see some downsides. What's good for the ISP isn't necessarily optimal for me.<br /><br />What I don't like about that 'service' is that one or more people could sit outside and suck down bandwidth (e.g. slow my connection down), unbeknownst to me. It also might cause the unit to use more energy and put out a stronger wi-fi signal than it needs to. Which health conscious people are well advised to be aware of. Wi-Fi is radiation. Not strong and may not ruin your life, but it is a stressor at a cellular level, this is known. And strong signals, persistent signals and people who are more sensitive or have immunity issues can be more vulnerable (headaches, sleep disruption, or worse).  But I like Wi-Fi so I settle for whatever unknown health consequences I may not be aware of.<br /><br />Also it makes me wonder if a hacker might be able to use it as an additional point of access to my home network.<br /><br />I also wonder if it's 100% clear to law enforcement at first glance who might be visiting sites or doing something nefarious from the connection point. Might it look like the owner is doing something that a passerby did (and even if they can sort it out later, what if it takes awhile to figure out and they make a bad assumption?)<br /><br />Anyway, I don't have that problem with this modem and I'm just much happier with it all the way around.<br /><br />Plus it's blazingly fast.",positive,negative
B00ZW0D5N2,5.0,"Projectors for home use are typically set up for home theater systems. I have seen a number of systems set up with projectors suspended from the ceiling, and I have seen a few that rely on being mounted on a table top. This is a table top model and it is a very good and easy-to-use projector.<br /><br />This is a 300-lumen projector which is fine for home theater systems, though it would be a little underpowered to use in a larger room or something like a small church. It is good for small presentations too and is a good option if you want to take it with you for meetings instead of keeping it permanently placed somewhere.<br /><br />There are several input sources for which the projector is configured. For testing and experimentation I found it easiest to work with HDMI though I was able to use some of the other sources as well. It accepts VGA (which is great for older computer systems and other hardware), it can read files from an SD card or even a USB drive. Using a USB drive or SD card, this projector becomes very compact and portable and doesn't even need an external source of input.<br /><br />This projector even has a pair of speakers inside so you can use this projector for the entire A/V experience, though you will get better sound from a dedicated sound system. This projector is capable of receiving sound as well as outputting it.<br /><br />I used the HDMI input to feed the image from my computer to the projector and it did a fine job of displaying my desktop on the wall for me. I was also able to configure Windows to use it as an extended display so I could then look at PowerPoint on the computer screen and use the projector to output the slide show. This is very, very convenient and makes this configuration ideal for presentations. I was able to adjust the focus manually and get the image as sharp as I wanted too.<br /><br />The remote with this unit is great. It provides full access to the projector's functions, so if the projector is on a shelf out of reach the remote is sufficient for any adjustments you may want to make. If you prefer not to use the remote or have some reason you would rather directly interact with the projector there are several buttons on the top of the projector that give access to the different functions. You can change the input source, power on and off and get into the menu system which allows you to tweak all manner of settings: brightness, change the resolution, update the firmware from USB, set the date and time and more.<br /><br />This projector does output a lot of heat – to be expected from a projector with a bright light in it. Make sure that you have decent ventilation in the room when using this projector unless you want the room to warm up. I did notice that when the projector is shut off, the fan stops too which is a minor disappointment – I would rather have had the fan continue for a few minutes afterward to cool down the LED.<br /><br />This is a nice projector. It accepts a lot of different input types, it works well for small rooms and home theaters and it is easy to take with you due to the small size. It is especially useful if you want to run your video or presentation from either USB or from the SD card. If you're looking for a small-scale projector, this is a good choice.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",positive,positive

We plugged it into our router with the cable that was provided. We installed software that located the camera and now we can view the camera through the web browser. We plan to install the app to our phones eventually. The camera is easy to control. We have used it primarily for spying on the cats so far, but I'm sure we'll come up with other occasions. The infrared camera works well even in low lighting or darkness and the images are pretty clear. You can set it up to detect motion and then email you when it detects movement. We're having fun playing around with it right now, but there are a lot of real-life applications where this will be handy to have.<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review.

B00456V6WQ,1.0,"These headphones do not cancel the noise in the traditional sense.  It's more like a white noise generator that adds a layer of static to block out quiet noises.

B01KI8XHTE,4.0,"I have been using an older Philips 28&#34; soundbar with a wired passive sub woofer.  When I saw this unit on sale at Amazon I decided to give it a try.  It is also 28&#34; wide, but includes a wireless powered sub woofer allowing me to place the sub anywhere in the room were I could access a power socket.  Set up is really easy.  Took only a few minutes.  Had to spend a little time understand the leds that display the various sound settings.  The sub connect automatically.  After I was sure everything was working as it should, I programmed my Harmony remote to control it and everything else connected to the TV.  No problems doing that.  So all in all I am very happy with the performance of this unit when compared to the one it replaced.",positive,positive
B07C4WCPG6,4.0,"I like these headphones for their quality and price. I have these and Samsung Galaxy buds. The Galaxy buds win in terms of convenience and features due to me having a Galaxy phone, but the X5 wins in terms of volume and bass. I like to listen to music with bass and the Galaxy buds just don't have that at all, plus noise cancelling is gimmicky on the buds and eventually I have to up the volume to truly drown out all noise, which is easier to do with the X5. Both headphones shine in different respects. When it comes to interacting with my phone I prefer the features provided by Galaxy buds, but when it comes to listening to music and comfort then I prefer the X5, plus the X5 is way more economical. The mic on both for calls were not impressive. They work well enough in a quiet room but when I'm in my car I have to turn off my AC to use them (the AC isn't blowing on my face, they just really pick up on the air blowing around in general). Overall I don't think most people will be disappointed with this purchase.",positive,positive

My husband also travels often for work, and likes to have noise-isolating headphones for his flights. We've owned a few different brands of around-the-ear headphones, and we've found the Sennheiser HD 429 to be both lighter (I don't feel like a helicopter pilot in these) and more durable than most the others (my 5yo is hard on gadgets!). The sound quality has been totally sufficient for our needs. I would agree with other reviews that the cord on this is a bit flimsy and is also unnecessarily long. I've doubled-up the extra length and put a tie around it, so it feels a bit sturdier and doesn't get in the way of anything or get caught.",positive,negative
B08BVHZFH1,4.0,"Instructions for this item were really clear and it was easy to setup. All I had to do was remove the plastic strips from the under the ear buds then they pair with the case. Then I turned my bluetooth on and found the item and they paired to my phone without any problem (I have a Samsung Galaxy S10+). I would have given 5 stars but the tap functions dont work so well. You are supposed to tap twice to pause or play music. This usually worked about 3 out of 5 when I tested on both ear buds. I tapped faster and slower to see if that would change the results, but it didnt. When it came to the three taps for previous/next song, the ear buds seemed confused and began pausing and playing the music at times. Again, I couldn't tell if I was tapping too fast or slow. This functions worked about 1-2 times out of 5 tries. The range is great though. I was able to leave my phone on my bed and walk out my front door (about 20 ft away) then outside to my front door and there was no static or insidication that the connection was fading. The volume is great as well with both or one ear bud in.",positive,positive
B0031RG2AG,4.0,"What looks like a flash, acts like a flash, but is much more than your average flash?<br /><br />This gadget provides a painless backup solution for businesspersons and students who can't survive without their trusty laptop/netbook/notebook and the information therein. Even for users unfamiliar with backup software, the Echo software included on the drive is a snap to use.  Once the backup drive is inserted into a USB port on your computer, it will take you through some simple steps to configure the backup. You can choose the easy predefined Automatic plan or you can choose the more advanced Custom backup plan. There is a Quick Start Guide, also included on the drive, which provides a brief explanation of the options that are available.<br /><br />When configuring your Custom backup profile, you can specify which file types you want backed-up. You can select ALL files, or there are some basic ones such as text, spreadsheet, presentation, music, videos, photos et al that you can select. There is also an OTHER category where you can define other file types that may be important to you, for example, zip, rar, pdf, etc. In addition, you select which folder(s) you want backed-up, set filters if required, and set the number of versions of files to keep, a useful option if you accidentally delete or modify a file. There is also the option to select an Automatic backup which activates every time you plug in your flash drive, and Live which continuously backs up your modified files to the flash drive without your intervention.<br /><br />Restoring files is just a matter of clicking on the Restore menu button, selecting the files and/or folders you want restored and setting the location where to restore the files, then hit RESTORE. Alternatively, if when creating your profile, you had decided not to password protect it and encrypt it, the files can be accessed quite easily from directly on the root of the backup drive in the My Backup folder.<br /><br />To backup another computer, you would have to install the software on that computer and set up another backup profile.<br /><br />This version of the Lexar Echo has only 16GB of storage capacity, and is really too small to back up more than one home computer with music and video files; it can barely back up one computer, much less two or more. On the other hand, it would certainly be good for business people on the road since they will generally be using smaller files and the backup is a no-brainer.<br /><br />While it has a good feel to it and the retractable connector saves losing caps, it is a bit on the `chunky' side and competes for space with other USB devices. It can also get damaged if you're not careful when moving the laptop around and it gets hit during the process, as it sticks out quite a bit.<br /><br />I did not check for backup/restore speeds nor did I follow up on the 2GB of free online backup space which was offered in the setup. It appears this is no longer available at DMAILER, the backup software manufacturer; but instead I was guided to check YuuWaa online backup services.<br /><br />Extremely handy for business or school use, and especially for people who have senior moments and accidentally delete or write over important files on a regular basis.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 8, 2011",positive,negative

B01MRIS3N4,3.0,"Not too bad a pair of headphones, They stop my little ones from grabbing my Beats. I bought these at a local retailer, in a spur of the moment for a long road trip. (5+ hours) They do charge rather quickly. In less than 20 minutes they were fully charged. So the kids could use them while on the trip.<br />I personally would have preferred that they could be charged while in use, they cannot, and immediately shut off when its attempted. My kids love to allow their devices to get super low on charge. I removed 1 - 1/2 stars for the charging decision.  I also remove 1/2 star because they feel slightly off when wearing them. The kids however have never noticed the wearing issue. They seem to like them a lot. Though my son told me he'll be sure to keep track of my Beats. I figure it has to do with these being on ear and the others over the ear. He's just like me and prefers over the ear. Chip off the old block.<br /><br />The wife and I have been able to watch TV and talk this evening in the hotel room. Where we use to always hear this or that.

B09SCT16CF,5.0,"This product description doesn't do this product justice. I am impressed. I am already a fan of Sanag products, so I expected this to be good. It is. I'll list everything I can think of below.<br /><br />I have been looking for an easy to use fitness watch for my 70+ years old mom. She mentioned interest in one, but I am not sure how much she will enjoy it. While I like fitbit (been using that brand since 2015) I didnt want to get her one if she wouldnt like the technology. I looked through what I already own, but nothing seemed right. I have a garmin that I wouldnt have anyone new to fitness watches use (hate that thing). I have an Amazon Halo, which is great but its attached to my account so I cant have her try it. And I have a weird off brand tracker that I got a few years ago that it too complicated to use (clunky app, slow to respond swiping). I basically need a tracker to be easy to use (both the tracker and the app) and be something I feel comfortable having my tech adverse mom use. I chose this based on what I read in the description AND my positive experience so far with Sanag.<br /><br />I figured I would try this watch for a couple of weeks before deciding if it would work for her. I have been wearing it day and night for a little over a week, and I may not give it to her.. because I love it. haha<br /><br />I'm just going to bullet point the features I have noticed so far:<br /><br />--waterproof. I wear it 24/7. Though I do take off for showering, I am just used to doing that. I also clean homes for living, and this can take a beating.<br /><br />-- easy to find, install, and use App (da fit), many customizations, options to set up.<br /><br />--pairs easily with bluetooth; no hassle.<br /><br />--interesting color, nice feeling band. Very secure feeling. Though,  I'd prefer the band to be a little longer.<br /> I have a 7"" wrist, and this just fits. Will be fine for my mom who has very petite bone structure.<br /><br />--super long battery life. I charge my fitbit sense every other day. Other than initial charge, I have not yet had to charge this.  I'd say they are accurate on their 7-14 day charge on normal use, or 30 days on standby. That being said..<br /><br />-- blood O2 measurment is on demand. Not automatic. Just go into watch face or app to measure. It keeps track.  Heart rate can be continuous measurement or on demand.<br /><br />--Can choose from many many many watch faces. So many different styles, some are super cute. Different faces depending on what you want to see, ie just the time, time and date, time, date, steps, hr, cals burned, etc. If you have a few that you like, then you can scroll through what you have used in your watch itself to to select one, or you can go to the app to select one.<br /><br />--steps are accurate as far as side by side with my Fit bit Sense. Same steps (within 20 steps) when worn side by side on same wrist.<br /><br />--gorgeous display- very colorful and easy to read<br /><br />--easy to navigate with swiping; very responsive. Easy to back out from selections.<br /><br />--on watch can see time, date, steps, heart rate, 02, blood pressure (havent checked yet for accuracy but I will), weather, sleep data, exercise specific date (and tracking), alarms, timers, music control, camera shutter control, and settings notifications (can set up to see notifications from many sources such as email, phone calls, texts, FB, IG, Whatsapp, etc etc ect-- huge list that can be turned on for notifications to allow to come through if you want. Can pick and choose).<br /><br />--on watch can select options such as ""do not disturb"", brightness settings, lock option,<br />--can connect to google fit<br />--can keep track of other health trends (menstrual, for example).<br />--can set a step goal, reminders to move, reminders to drink water<br /><br />I am not sure if there is a spot to adjust how long the face stays lit when looking at something. As of now, it goes black after a few seconds. Much like other fitness watches.<br /><br />--App has all this same info, with ability to look at more details<br /><br />--VERY easy to navigate app.<br /><br />REALLY an impressive gadget. I think some of it will come down to preference. I am still getting used to it, and sometimes I find the outer button is easily pressed by my bent wrist. I have accidentally changed my watch face that way, but I am seeing now that if I end up on that screen I have to make sure I am setting the face by swiping up (otherwise navigates to another face by swiping left/right). Litte annoyances that will vary.<br /><br />For all that it offers, for the ease of use especially compared to some name brands, I am compelled to go 5 stars. If we could do half stars, maybe 4.5. But I like it more than 4 stars. Overall nothing glaring bad or super negative comes to mind. I'll update as I learn more or think of more, or experience something different (good or bad).<br /><br />reasonable price at $79 (though I had a coupon which really helped make my decision), any higher and I would go with namebrand.",positive,negative
B008D76Q64,5.0,"I really like these...  the flat wires DO help them not to tangle... Has a &#34;universal&#34; tip as most things do this day and age... worked with my brand new LG G4 cell, my old rotary dial IPOD and my Kindle 8&#34; HDX.  It comes with 4 (2 sets) of extra ear cushions.  I feel that I have smallerish ears and I have a hard time finding earpods that are comfortable and will stay in.  These work great.  Comfortable and they have stayed in.  Mind you, I am NOT jogging with them in.  I only wish they'd come with a zipper case to hold them in for convenience.  At the price point, you'd think they would.  It does also have a microphone and I have &#34;tested&#34; that... worked. It has a little attachable pinch clip to keep in place as you move around. The foam tips are sort of like memory foam, but almost a bit softer really.  I think this both helps them stay in AND retain comfort.  The sound is very clean and clear - for an adult anyway.  The tips are cornflower blue if that matters to anyone... I think the pic is very clear and representative. I will update if there are any issues.<br />UPDATE: 6/29/2015 I have used these earbuds a number of times... one of the issues I have had in the past is that this &#34;shape&#34; of earbud doesn't want to stay in my ear... (tiny ears?) but these DO stay in.. I think it's the type of foam tip... seems to grip a bit better? To be fair, again, I am not jogging with them in... I am mostly in a sitting position using them. The &#34;flat&#34; wires really do help them not get all tangled... having stay that.. they also resist &#34;wrapping&#34; a bit too.  This is probably good. Otherwise you'd break the wires inside. The kiss of death to any wired accessory. Also, I've been informed that these are going to start coming with carry cases!!  Yup.  That would make them 5 star in my humble opinion and I'm keeping them in my &#34;save&#34; pile for a possible second order.<br />UPDATE 7/26/2015... Still happy with my purchase.  I am informed by the seller that they are now including a case.  This makes it definitely a 5-star value and worthy of a purchase.

B007CMB81O,1.0,"I ordered this remote to use with a Kenwood head unit I already had on my boat.  Upon delivery, the unit had 7 small cracks along the side edge of faceplate.  The cracks coincided with the 4 screws that secure the front faceplate to the rear housing (there is a seal between the front face and rear housing).  It appears that excessive clamping forces of these screws caused the cracks.  Being in a marine environment, the cracks are completely unacceptable as moisture and condensation can easily work its way into the unit.  I returned the remote for refund and ordered a second one in its place.  When the second remote arrived, careful inspection showed that it too, had cracks along the edge of the front faceplate.  The second remote had 2 cracks.  Emails to Kenwood didn't help at all (i even included pictures) and they said they've never heard of such an issue before.  Based on the design aspect alone, I HIGHLY doubt this is an isolated event to both of the remotes I've seen.  I'm sure many MANY more of them are damaged during production.  If you have this remote, make a close inspection of it but BEWARE as Kenwood customer service has warned me that they will refuse warranty work on any item that appears to have physical damage.  With this unit, it comes damaged OUT OF THE BOX.  Copy and paste the link to see 3 of the 7 cracks in the 1st remote.<br /><br />[...]",negative,negative

B09C3KN2BN,4.0,"I listen to audiobooks to fall asleep at night so I wear ""sleep"" earbuds as to not disturb my wife.  I usually buy the soft silicone type, which never have good audio quality, but does the job.

They also have excellent build quality.  There are silicone reinforcements at all of the wire connection points to protect them from failing due to tugging and the shape of the earbuds are as flat as possible.<br /><br />When in my ears, these metal earbuds do not protrude at all, they lie flat.

The stereo is also very heavy on the bass (especially for how small it is). Anyone that hears this unit will immediately be impressed by the volume and bass extension from such a small unit. In fact it's actually /too much/ bass for me some of the time because I like to listen to certain talk radio stations. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone wishing to listen primarily to talk radio. The sound quality is a tad bit sub par to a discerning ear if you're picky but I don't mind it because it looks great and I have other speakers for more pure listening.

B00XQ37XR6,3.0,"I got a couple of these where Spotify offered them  @ 50% off $50 sale...<br />I'd say Its somewhere between 2-3.5 stars.<br /><br />Pluses:<br />* The Bluetooth works well.<br />* The features are kinda cool (pressing the side of the headphone to stop/play/forward/backward playlists).<br />* Above feature even works with Spotify on my Windows computer.<br />* The wire where you plug-in w/o using bluetooth is kinda cool so can use without using power.<br />* feature to share the bluetooth w/ a wire to a friend is cool. Me and sis watched a meteor shower and I played some tunes we could share w/o disturbing our quiet suburban neighborhood.<br /><br />Minuses:<br />* I'm 5'3&#34; with a small to regular-sized head, and it feels too tight and hurts ears after 30m-1hr. Almost a deal breaker.<br />* The headphones themselves feel tight, but also don't wrap around your ear like some headphones and dont stay on tightly. Like they are the size of your ear which I don't find very comfortable.<br />* The power button and USB charger port are right in the area where the headphone can rotate (and be half covered by the plastic).<br />Its annoying to access those buttons sometimes .<br />* sometimes accidentally activate the touch feature. Could be set to be less sensitive.",positive,negative

B00CD1PTF0,5.0,"I installed these on an iMac computer.  The speakers are smaller than I expected from the pictures. They are approximately 7-3/4"" high by 3-1/4"" wide by 5-3/4"" in depth.  Installation was extremely easy and took a few minutes.  The AC power adapter piece slides and locks into the AC power supply.  After that the audio cable gets attached to the right speaker from the computer input to the headphone jack on the back of the computer.  Then the cable rom the left speaker goes into the slot by that name on the right speaker. The AC power adapter then gets plugged into your home outlet and the cable end goes into the jack marked DC power on the right speaker. After this it is just a matter of adjusting the computer volume to 75% on the computer and then turning on the right speaker by adjusting the knob to the volume desired.  One improvement I would recommend is an on/off light for the speakers.<br /><br />On the back of the right speaker, plug another device into the AUX IN to listen to a different audio device.<br /><br />I played a few tunes from an iTunes playlist both with the computer volume and then again with these speakers.  To my ears the sound through these speakers is crisp, clear, and deep.  I love them!  In my opinion, this is another great product from Bose.<br /><br />UPDATE: Watching videos on the iMac with this system is awesome.  My boyfriend and I love the acoustics and feel as if we're in a theatre.",positive,positive

B07T6HCNVT,5.0,"While I tend to use wireless headphones most of the time, there are times, such as when flying that I need wired headphones and these are AWESOME.<br /><br />These headphones are equipped with an iPhone Lightning Connector which is the perfect size to fit through the opening in the case on my iPhone, it snaps into place without issue and provides a stable connection.<br /><br />The set comes with the headphones, a rubber squeeze case, 3 sets of silicone ear bud tips, 3 sets of silicone ear bud wings, and a wire clip.<br /><br />I found that the preinstalled tips and wings (medium) fit perfectly for me.<br /><br />The sound from these headphones is excellent - from the rich bass notes to the vibrant midtones to the bright treble.  I tested these headphones with a wide range of audio - from audiobooks to jazz, heavy metal, country, classical and blues - everything sounded amazing.<br /><br />The noise cancelling feature works really well on these headphones.  Noise cancelling is a complex process where a processor must detect ambient noise, both frequency and amplitude, through the microphone and then “block it” by creating an exactly opposite noise thus cancelling out the ambient noise.  Some noises are more easily cancelled than others and some processors within headphones do a better job at cancelling than others.  I have to say I am thoroughly impressed with the noise cancelling these headphones achieve.<br /><br />The microphone picks up perfectly on calls in my tests the other person had no issues hearing me crystal clear.<br /><br />The control module allows you to easily increase or decrease the volume.  Start / stop / pause music or answer / end calls.<br /><br />These are a great set of wired headphones that performed very well in all of my tests.  This is definitely a product I would recommend.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

B09CTLKD53,4.0,"These little earbuds come with their charging case and a USB cable to charge. They were 30% charged when I received them so I plugged them in overnight to fully charge. The red light on the case never went off or changed so I don't know if it's supposed to when fully charged.  The sound is clear, not a lot of bass as I would prefer but at least they have a good crisp sound. The buds are also very comfortable to wear for awhile.  They did not irritate my ears at l. I have to get used to the sensitivity of the touch button on the bud, though. They are very sensitive to touch and if you're trying to adjust the fit, you'll be pausing or forwarding a song in the process, but that's just my issue. Happy with these and looking forward to using them often. They paired quickly to my android devices and the directions included were simple to follow.",positive,positive
B000V1ONTW,5.0,"I'm pleasantly surprised by this sub.  I took advantage of a huge savings on Amazon (had to wait a few months to get it, but that was ok).  There are tons of features built into the panel and the power this projects is amazing.  I have a large open living room, so finding a sub that can fill it was pretty hard...but this is the one.  If you can afford it, go for it.<br /><br />**Update 27 Nov 2010**  After a few days of playing the new Gran Turismo 5 I'm amazed at how much power this sub has.  I have my PS3 on top of the sub and it nearly fell off from the vibrations.  I'll update later once I've updated the other speakers in my setups...currently they're the lim-fac in my sound system.",positive,positive
B01LYFI8UF,3.0,"I deducted 1 star because there is only 1 HDMI port on this TV, when there really should be 2.<br /><br />I deducted another star because they put a label right on the screen itself that left behind residue upon peeling it off. This is unacceptable on a television.<br /><br />The TV is lightweight. The picture is pretty good for a $130 TV. I like that it has both RCA audio out jacks and a headphone jack. If you really want a small size TV, this is certainly one to consider.",positive,negative

So, needless to say, he uses the bigger 6.55 male size for headphone/piano.

B07FMPRTX3,4.0,"I have the Jabra 35 headset also and this one is noticably different with regard to the quality of phone calls, but that's really the only material difference I can find in my day to day use. The other unit does offer some noise cancellation effects that this one doesn't have and people you call can definitely tell the difference. My husband said that he could hear background noise much more clearly when I called him from this 15 than with the 35.<br /><br />As far as battery life, this thing is really solid. I've used for three hours on two different days without recharging between days. I primarily use it to listen to audiobooks while I'm doing my barn chores and checking fence lines. I have noticed that I'm pretty limited with the distance I can stray from my physical phone before this headset begins to stutter to lose signal - it seems to be about 20 feet with my Sony Xperia phone.",positive,positive

B001V9LA44,4.0,"Second update.  Played Stone Angel DVD.  Froze for 3 minutes at the 1:16 mark.  Played the same scene again using my Sony upscaling DVD.  Played perfectly.  Replayed the same scene again in the BD 60. Again froze at the exact same point.  Definitely a BD60 problem.  My firmware is current.<br /><br />Update:  Joined Netflix.  Two Blue Ray movies so far.  Slumdog Millionaire played perfectly.  However there was an 11 minute freeze on Benjamin Buttons.  Freeze from 1:16-1:27.  I rebooted twice and tried different fixes.  Nothing worked.  I was never able to view these 11 minutes.  I have the latest firmware update.<br /><br />Original review.  I came close to a 3 star rating.  Contrary to other comments, I think the remote is confusing.  I'm still using the manual when I watch TV, and I know my wife will never use it.  I have my Sony DVD with upgrade ability on top of my Blue Ray, and plan to use it on regular DVDs.  The Sony remote is so easy to use, and so feature packed.  This Panasonic has excellent Blue Ray quality, and great sound. Just watched Slumdog Millionaire, played to perfection.<br /><br />Firmware upgrade was painless, easily downloads You Tube (turned out to be a very enjoyable feature).  Watched Neil Diamond in concert, from You Tube, to my TV, in VG quality.  However, I just joined Netflix, and am disappointed there is no Netflix capability.  I knew this when I ordered, buy I didn't realize how expensive the Amazon VOD program is.  I will probably replace this new Panasonic with one that downloads Netflix, and give this to my daughter.  Don't want Roku, though I have read mostly good things about it.<br /><br />My equipment.  Maganavox 720 P (not high end, 3 years old, but stunning picture).  Hooked Blue Ray using component cables, since TV will only display 720 P.  Sony receiver-no HDMI inputs.  It's 10 years ago, but was high end.  Using Linksys router, Linksys switcher.

B01J7K0VHU,4.0,I got these to use for watching video on my Kindle at night. I have some hearing loss and I find it's easier to hear with something like this. These are light and comfortable. They paired quickly and easily. The only problem and it's kind a show stopper is that the audio and video are out of sync while these are connected. As soon as I turn them off everything is fine. Would love to know how to fix that because out of sync makes me crazy after a few shows.,positive,positive
B004RO9L50,5.0,"The HP 7 inch Digital Picture Frame (model df730p1) was the quickest to set up of any digital frame I've used.  My first impression upon receiving the box was that it was packaged economically, a plus in my book with no extraneous styrofoam materials for protecting in the box.  I was then impressed by the actual frame which is described as, ""Dark Espresso Front Concave, 1 Decorative Paper Mat, double color: White on Espresso.""  It's lovely and the paper matte gives it a more finished appearance.  This frame can be rotated if desired, as can the photos.  I looked at the quick set up guide, read the very complete manual and then removed the frame from its package, plugged it in and turned it on.  The internal slideshow began in seconds and I was eager to replace the graphics and pictures with my own.  Seeing that this has a calendar, I switched from the default date in 2008 and set it to the current date and time.  Options exist to display the calendar with the photo in the upper corner or to have the time displayed in a small font, but I selected neither of those options and went for just the pictures to be run in a slideshow at 5 second intervals.  Being able to set a schedule for images is a great advantage, allowing for the slideshow to cease when it's not needed to run.  I set all these things with the intuitive little remote control which can be attached to the rear of the frame by the enclosed magnet.  Smart option.  The LCD screen is 480x234 and the image is very clean.  With a 5-in-one card reader, you can use SD, MMC, XD, MS, MSPro or MMC.  This model has an internal memory of 128 MB which supposedly can run up to 800 compressed images and there is also a mini USB port.  A little dial on the side enables you to adjust the brightness of the image.  Only JPEG files can be read and there is no speaker, so keep in mind that it's a visual frame.  Most menu options are very logical and easy to follow, and a majority can be accessed via the device itself, without using the remote.  Although the remote action does take a second or two to register, I've found that preferable.  All in all, I think this is a very nice frame in this price range and would not hesitate to recommend it.",positive,positive
B07LGVQ8TC,5.0,"This speaker is great.  I've got an Echo Dot in my bathroom connected to this and I can hear the sound clearly in the shower (the Echo needs to be really loud to hear without this, since it isn't in the shower with me).

Okay, that's a pretty specific reason to want one of these, but there it is...",positive,negative
B076HPQQ7Q,5.0,"My daughter loves this. Very cute, stylish looking headphones, and surprisingly comfortable to wear. My kids especially don't like earbuds, so the over-the-ear style like these are a welcome alternative. I was actually impressed at how much noise isolation they provide... it really blocks out the outside sound, you end up yelling when trying to talk without realizing, and that's not even when there is any music playing! Sound quality is OK- not as amazing as my brand name speakers, but good enough for what it is. A little echo-ey, but a worthwhile compromise for the over-the-head style and this level of noise isolation.",positive,positive
B06XCM9LJ4,5.0,"The echo is great, and Alexa is great. I only wish that the volume ring was back in this version... I miss it from the first generation echo. In comparing the sound fro the first-generation echo, I can't tell much of a difference. The sound is better on my Google Home. On the Echo, sound is a bit flat to my ears. The Microphone picks up very well though, as good or better than my Google home, and the first-generation echo.",positive,negative
B01FY6NC2W,4.0,"I loaded paper and ink without even reading the instructions - just super easy. BE AWARE the FIRST package you get of paper and ink do not do a full 10 prints - it's like a ""sampler"" (lots of misunderstanding about this) - after that you get the full 10 prints.  I'm using it to print old photos from my hard drive to give to family members and it cleans them up nicely.  It's just so easy to use it's amazing BUT you are restricted to their products - which luckily are not that expensive given the cost of other ink and paper packages.  I just need to figure out how to resize photos that won't fit in the size limit of the photo - I'm sure there is editing software out there that does it but I've never done much picture editing so if anybody has any suggestions it would be appreciated. I'm trying to not cut off the people on the ends of each size. I've tried it horizontal and vertical but it just won't shrink it down.  It's also pretty fast and cool to watch as it layers each color on the page. Hasn't failed once - all errors have been mine.  Do wish it had some suggestions about editing or at least tell you if you CAN use editing software with this.  Also - always leave it ON to keep the ink from drying out.",positive,positive

I cannot speak to the audio quality, as I have not tested them myself. But they are still working after being toted around by a 6th grader, so that's something.",positive,positive
B07VTK654B,2.0,"after having it for a few months, I would not recommend it. Unlike the Alexa in your home where you just speak, there are several conditions that just be in place for this to work. As a result, I never use it.<br /><br />However, as far as integration with my Toyota Prius goes ( and there is a very good chance this is Toyota), it is not as easy as the one you use at home. You must be on the right mode- for me it's the bluetooth mode. You won't hear it if you are tuned to am or fm.<br /><br />It is slower to respond. At home you say Alexa (baby pause) and then your request. In the car, it's Alexa (WAIT) . . . then speak your command. Half the time it dissolves into no response.<br /><br />As a result, I don't use it as much as I do the ones at home. And in case you think I'm a  rookie, I have 4 Echo products in my one bedroom condo. So I recommend it with reservation. I still want it, I don't want to return it, but it needs work, not sure who to blame.",negative,negative

Would be easier if they had a built in microphone.<br /><br />Also, if you have hair longer than an inch, it’ll get caught in the joints and get torn out.<br /><br />Aside from that, easy to set up, good battery life, okay construction.",negative,negative
B002RJUSO0,4.0,"Purchased this for a new build, retiring my seven year old system for a more modern and faster platform. This monitor was icing on the cake. Arrived packed securely without any dead pixels. Picture is clear and crisp with great color. Large display with full 1080p resolution and a very fast reaction time excellent for gaming or movie watching. It has a variety of ports including HDMI, DVI, and good old VGA. I cannot comment on the speakers as I own some high end Logitechs and have never bothered to hook up the built in audio. In a pinch, I suppose, it is nice to have it in case I ever need it.<br /><br />Bottom line: I recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a quality product at a good price.",positive,positive

Sometimes I have to go out in the rain and it can get a little hectic trying to control the joystick with one hand and hold onto an umbrella in the other.  This is perfect for holding the umbrella.  I simply clamp one side to the handle and the other side to the back of the chair.

The sound quality is better than expected and it has a few different input/output options (auxiliary, RCA) . It never turns off and has a blue light on top so you can easily see when it's in pairing mode. I haven't tested the distance on it because I have an open floorplan and all of my devices are within 15 ft of the Esinkin. The first one of these that I ordered came in as a dud, no light, no pairing with any device. I contacted the seller and they responded quickly, asked for my address and sent me a new one right away.

B00E5P4PWU,3.0,"This review is for the rock bluetooth 8"" speakers. I figured the larger size speaker would provide better bass and better sound compared to the smaller 5 1/2"" models, but I have not been impressed. The bass is lacking and the sound generally sounds weak - like the radio in an old car or an AM transistor radio. . . just weak, somewhat tinnie. Fortunately I got them through Amazon Warehouse (used like new) for half the price of the new ones, so I'll go ahead and use them til they die. I've gotten spoiled by the great bass and sound my little Bose Mini Soundlink puts out, so when it's time for patio/pool/landscape speakers, next time I'll probably spend the bucks on Bose.",positive,negative

B09P832K7Z,4.0,"I love the concept of bone conducting headphones, and if you haven't tried a set before you really should! The sensation is a little unsettling at first but when you get used to it, you are rewarded with the ability to hear deep bass in your sounds without covering your ears completely the way ear buds and over-the-ear headphones require. They're not for everyone admittedly, but I love that I can feel/hear the sound and still be aware of my surroundings and able to respond if someone calls my name.<br />Good bone conducting headphones are easily 2x-3x the price of these, so keep that in mind. This is not going to be an alternative to a big name brand set. However, they aren't terrible either, and I kind of like them for the novelty of it at the price point.<br />If audio quality is your primary goal, understand that for the same money you can get a very decent pair of traditional headphones that will outshine this. But where's the fun in that?<br />4 stars for the novelty of it, but I give the sound quality and cost value only 3 stars.",positive,positive

They don't move nearly as  smoothly as headphones I've tried at much lower price points.<br /><br />The bottom line is even though they look nice and sound decent, I'm going to reach for these less because they're just not as comfortable as other pairs I own (some of which cost less than this pair)",positive,negative

B00E4JWL50,3.0,"The GOOD:<br />These work well for hearing dialog and hushed speaking, or when it's accompanied with a lot of background noise in certain movies and tv shows.  Also work well if someone is hard-of-hearing, so that you don't have to crank up the volume on the tv (the volume of each headset is individually adjustable).  We've found it also works well if one person watching tv while others in the room are playing games or watching something else on their tablets.<br />The BAD:<br />These are extremely Line-Of-Sight.  The base unit has to be aimed directly where you're seated, and if you're sitting just a couple/few feet to either side, you'll start getting more & more static.  If I stand up to grab something from the other side of the room, the static will overtake the tv audio dialog completely and I have to take them off my head.  Seems strange that the technology is so limited on these, requiring near perfect seating placement.  I'll even get brief blasts of static just by raising my hand up to my face, as it seems to partially block the signal coming from the base unit.<br />Overall worth having but could definitely be improved.",positive,negative

B002CTFNAY,5.0,"I mainly use [[ASIN:B002GOYU0O 12 pc Velcro Ties Reausable Electrical Wire Cable Strap]], which meet most of my needs. I also use these and like them a lot.<br /><br />Where these come in handy, and even augment my preferred strap, is they are nearly immovable once you tie them to a brace of other anchoring point. For example, if you are setting up with a keyboard, the stand makes a good anchor point for cross-stage cable runs. This is especially true of Z-style stands like the [[ASIN:B0002F6JH6 On Stage 2 Tier Folding Z Keyboard Stand]] (although X-style stands work well).  This does take some pre-planning because you do not want to interfere with other musicians or, worse, create trip hazards.<br /><br />Because you loop the narrow end through the eyelet on the wider end and pull this strap has more holding strength than someone who is only running cables on stage and in a studio will ever need.  Frankly, I augmented my preferred brand and model with these because of cost - and they are worth every penny. At 8"" you can safely run more than a few instrument, speaker and microphone cables through one anchored to a frame like the Z-stand I mentioned above, and still keep the strap sufficiently loose to prevent stretching or breaking cables run through it.<br /><br />Think of it as one more handy tool in your bag of tricks if running and managing cable is one of the things you do.

Not being able to use my primary  TV streaming service is a show stopper. Shame as it could have been a great device, I suspect it's a processor and/or lack of memory issue, but not certain. Will be selling it CHEAP and replacing with with a ROKU or Invidia Shield.",negative,negative

B08F9S3SD5,5.0,"Like most households today, we have so many cables. It seems like every device needs a different type of cable, be it HDMI, USB-A, USB-C, USB-mini... it's nuts! I personally can't wait for all of our devices to be switched over to the current industry standard USB-C so I can at least reduce *some* of the clutter! But until that day comes (if ever), I am trying to at least organize our cable collection to where we can grab what we need without having to sift through a sea of black cables, examining all of the ends looking for the right one.<br /><br />Enter these Avyxm USB C to C 4 foot cables. I chose the red and LOVE THEM!! They are very vibrant and bright making it stupid easy to quickly grab the correct cable for our USB-C devices!! The cables are nice and thick but still with a bit of bend allowing for maneuvering around furniture legs or nightstand lamps without putting a kink in them. And one of the biggest props? These cables FAST CHARGE everything I've connected them to. Our Samsung Galaxy S8 and S10 phones, my new Fire HD8 Plus tablet and my kids' Samsung S10 plus phones. The 4 foot length is perfect for bedside nightstands although it is a little too short to reach the couch and still use the phone or tablet in a comfortable position -- so I'll be grabbing a couple of the 6 foot cables for living room use.<br /><br />Bottom line... the color is fantastic, the build quality is supreme, I don't expect they'll ever kink given their thickness, I love the braiding and feel of the fabric -- overall a high quality product that I have and will continue to, highly recommend!",positive,positive

B07MFNPP2Z,5.0,"I got this product because I like to ride my stationary bicycle while I watch a film on my computer. In the past, I used a set of headphones for audio. However, the cable was cumbersome and got in the way. With this product I can listen to my computer without having annoying wires interfering with my enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />The headphones are high quality and feature great sound reproduction. The purchase price includes headphones, a transmitter, a power cable, a micro USB charging cable, an RCA converter cable, a digital optical cable, and a 3.5mm audio cable. The USB cable can be used to charge the headphones, or you can use the transmitter which features a headphone cradle.<br /><br />I elected to connect this to my computer with the 3.5mm audio cable and it works great. The headphones have a volume key which is easy to operate while you're wearing them. This is a high quality item that is comfortable to wear and provides good sound. The packaging is also very attractive which makes this a thoughtful gift idea.",positive,positive
B07F1FTJ7R,5.0,"[[VIDEOID:2e7c0a6adbe4e28b15ec850150bf83ab]] Please check out the pictures that I provided for size and picture quality comparison between the TOUMEI Mini Projector and the [[ASIN:B008BUQ16S Vivitek Qumi Q5]].<br /><br />**If you read through the entire review, I hope that I can provide some information that may help you get the most out of this projector.<br /><br />THE REVIEW<br />I already owned a QUMI Q5, which was $500 when it came out and I really like the projector but I found that I did not take it with me very often when I travel because while the projector is small, it did not have built in battery and could not be powered by USB, requiring me to bring a power adapter.  It also did not have Android so I had to bring a separate device such as a laptop or firetv.  What this meant was that I ended up having to take up a lot of space in my bag for all the accessories necessary just to make the QUMI work.<br /><br />The TOUMEI solves both problems for me.  It has a built-in battery that should run for a couple of hours and can be charged using a USB charger (which I would bring with me anyway).  Just remember that you need a charger with a high amperage (2.1A at least).  With the built in Android, don't need to bring an additional media device.  All I need to pack is the projector and its remote control.  With the HDMI port, I still have the option to connect a laptop or FireTV to the projector (see caveats)<br /><br />As you can see in my pictures and video, the TOUMEI looks just as good, if not better, than the QUMI when projecting a 30"" picture.  Fun fact:  The TOUMEI was running on battery power when I was filming my comparison video.  Projection brightness isn't lowered because it is running on battery power.<br /><br />So for my use, the TOUMEI deserves its 5-Stars.  I also want to give props to TOUMEI for updating the projector from Android 4 to Android 7.1.2.  That's a 3-version jump!  With that said, the projector is not perfect.<br /><br />CAVEATS:<br />- Netflix not supported (See tips for workarounds)<br />- In HDMI mode, there are no keystone controls and auto-keystone doesn't work.  This means you are forced to front-project and the projector must be level to the screen.  I wrote an email to TOUMEI support and they were quite responsive.  Unfortunately, they do not have a solution for this.<br />- Bluetooth mouse doesn't work very well.  I've tried two bluetooth mice with the project but the pointer jumps around the screen, making it hard to use.  Using a logitech usb mouse/keyboard worked well and mouse movement was smooth.<br /><br />TIPS:<br />- Streaming apps:  There is a builtin app called freeclick.  From there, you can install a version of Amazon Videos and Youtube that works with remote control navigation.  You can also install Netflix from there, but it is a very old version that was designed for touch/mouse input (see Netflix tip).<br />- Better UI:  I was able to install ""Leanback Launcher for Fire TV"" (search google and click on the xda-developers link).  Leanback is the codename for the launcher that is built in to Android TV.  It is a more modern-looking launcher than what the projector came with.  Also install ""TV App Drawer"" from the Play Store to show all apps that the Leanback Launcher hides.<br /><br />- Better UI Alternative:  I also tried out ATV Launcher from the Play Store and that is a launcher that looks just like the Leanback launcher but has more options but some are locked unless you purchase the PRO version.<br /><br />NETFLIX:<br />The newer versions of the Netflix app no longer support any Android boxes that aren't on their ""white list"" so only version 4 or earlier work (Netflix is at version 7 as of this writing).  So while the Netflix that is included with the projector works, it is old and you really need a mouse to use it.  There are a few workarounds that you can try though:<br /><br />- Miracast:  While there is a builtin app for casting an android phone to the projector, it is buggy and doesn't retain the phone's aspect ratio, stretching the picture out.  Instead, install AirScreen from the Play Store.  The popup ads can be annoying unless you pay to remove them but AirScreen is the most stable Miracast receiver software I've used.  It also supports Apple Airplay, Google Cast, and DLNA.  With AirScreen, you can cast Netflix from your phone to the projector.<br /><br />- FireTV:  With the HDMI port, you can connect a FireTV to the projector and take advantage of all the great services that Amazon provides.  Just remember that in this case, you cannot adjust the keystone in any way and ceiling mounting or rear-projection modes are not available.<br /><br />- Kodi:  As opposed to what you may have read, Kodi is not illegal.  It is simply a great video player that supports addons.  There are some addons that are bad, but Kodi itself is not illegal or malware in any way.  So basically, only install Kodi either from their official website at kodi.tv or through the Play Store.<br /><br />Kodi has a Netflix plugin (Search ""Netflix Add-on [input-stream]"") and click on the Kodi Community Forum link.  Again, this plugin is not illegal and does not circumvent Netflix security in any way.  You are still required to provide your Netflix login.  I will not go into the installation instructions here because it will make this review even longer than it already is.<br /><br />I hope that I was able to help some of you with my review and tips.  Thanks for reading!",positive,negative
B07PGLJ4P3,5.0,"I got the ""acceptable"" unit for total $17 (sorry), one foot pad is missing,  I'll innovate.  Firstly,  I had wanted the chrome front but couldn't afford it and didn't want to wait a week; when I saw this used for the price I just pushed the button.<br /><br />From the pictures you would think the front is all matte black, it is not. It's actually a very dark brown and the controls are a dark bronze,  in shiny metal; closer to chrome aesthetic and looks far better with more tones than the photos would suggest. I'm actually happy I bought the darker color now seeing it.  I tried to capture this on my pic, but it's too dark and still doesn't capture the wonderful appearance.<br /><br />Plugging it in and turning it on was instantly satisfying, easy to use controls,  no stiffness,  good quality,  lights work, radio is a deep amber or orange.  Nice wood, looks and operates easily and great.<br /><br />Tuning to a somewhat hard to get classical station locally was surprisingly easy and the signal came in loud and clear,  unlike the other radios I've tried from Amazon.  It felt like an old stereo where you didn't have to give it thought and was instinctive in the first 30 seconds without the difficulty and poor reception and static and crackling of tuning and volume controls or pops of turning it on nearly all cheap modern radios have now.<br /><br />Bluetooth connected and performed seamlessly, perhaps a little softer than the radio but not horribly so.  And the sound... On both radio and bluetooth the sound quality is superb; *just* enough bass without being muddy and the treble is good and clear. Bass in the voices and high pitches in the music,  and very loud without screech or static at still low volume on the knob, with room-filling sound on FM and bluetooth.<br /><br />This is the most pleasing product I've purchased from Amazon in a long time,  especially in the radio category.<br /><br />Update:  After trying several others,  I bought a second one! Like New $21. The only thing I notice is neither sits perfectly evenly,  there's a slight wobble,  even with all four feet pads.  No biggie. Love the radio,  excellent big sound,  bass, but not muddy. Best radio on Amazon,  and a true ""table radio"".",positive,positive
B08DXSG5QR,5.0,"When the lockdown started last year, I decided to look for an external webcam for my laptop.  I talked with a couple of friends who recomended the Logitech 920, so Iooked on Amazon and was shocked at the cost.  It normally went for about $60, but when I looked it was $200.  I wasn't going to pay that high a price, so I tried a couple of low cost alternatives, both of which I had to return.<br />Then I found out about the Emeet webcam from a friend of mine.  He said it worked great and so at $27, I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did because it's a great little webcam.  The camera iteslf is high quality and auto focus.  It has a wider field of view than my laptop camera and also has a decent microphone.  I'm very happy with the purchase and now use it most of the time on Zoom calls.  If you are looking for an alternative to the 920, this is definitely it.  The only issue is that I wish it had a privacy screen, but the 920 doesn't have one either so it's a fair comparison.<br />If you are looking for a good webcam grab this one, it's a great deal.",positive,positive

B00SLUI5SA,5.0,"I'm a musician with a home studio.  With several sets of headphones all getting old, I decided to invest in some new ones. I've had good luck with Sennheiser in the past so I wanted to check out what they were currently offering. After reading lots of reviews, I decided to give these rs175 rf's a try. I was a little leery of them being wireless but trusting in the Sennheiser name, bought them anyway. I wanted them for general recording and playback.<br /><br />Pros: Excellent sound... flat, uncolored. Clear detailed, etc. All the qualities I've come to expect from Sennheiser.  Wireless setup was virtually nothing... plug in the base where you'd plug in the headphones and you're done. Turn on the headphones and start listening. The stand serves as the charging station and placing the headphones on it is straightforward and secure... not clumsy at all. I have a fairly large head with proportional sized ears... (size xxl hat). The ear pads fit completely over my ears and completely seal very nicely around them.  You won't be bothered by outside sounds, nor will your spouse be bothered by what you're listening to.  A quick check of the range shows I can go anywhere in my average size home without losing the signal. (I didn't try going outside).<br /><br />Cons: The only negative is that there is a bit of latency. If you use them for listening to music or even tv, you won't notice it... but if you turn on speakers at the same time and listen to both, you'll notice a very slight lag in the headphones.<br /><br />Bottom line: these are excellent headphones, quality of build and quality of sound are both first rate. But if that latency is an issue, you probably shouldn't be looking at wireless anyway (I suspect this occurs on any wireless system).",positive,positive
B00W143DV6,5.0,"The wallet may be marketed as a phone holder, but it is a wallet first and foremost. It is attractive and the zipper functions well, with very shiny gold colored hardware and a nice wrist strap.

It holds quite a bit, including a phone, making it a good accessory to carry when I don't want to take a purse or backpack with me. Since it is closed by a single surrounding zipper, I don't hear the phone if it rings unless the volume is turned to the highest and the zipper is left with an open gap.

B0B46BJJXK,4.0,"I prefer trackballs like this one to regular mice, and I like the fact that this one is bigger than average so I decided to give it a try. So far I am pleased with it, though it isn't perfect.<br /><br />DELUX is not a brand with which I was previously familiar so I wasn't sure what to expect. My requirements are fairly simple - it has to work with a dongle and it needs to work under both Linux and Windows. It definitely meets both of those requirements nicely and it has not given me any issues. I usually do not use mice with Bluetooth connections so this feature, while useful for connecting to multiple systems, is wasted on me. The dongle, however, is immediately picked up by the Linux kernel as well as by Windows and I was able to plug this in and go with no delays and no effort.<br /><br />This is indeed a larger trackball and it fits my hands wonderfully. I have the hands of a gorilla and finding mice and trackballs that fit me is a challenge and I usually end up settling for something that is less than ideal for me. In this case, the trackball feels good in my hands and there is no strain on my thumbs as I don't have to stretch my hand in weird ways to reach the ball properly.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned that this trackball tends to skip. I have not observed this issue, though I have not had it long and I have not tried to use it with the computer more than a foot away. I also have not tried connecting via Bluetooth, which is when I have had troubles in the past with pointing devices.<br /><br />One thing that would have made this trackball better would have been quiet clicking of the buttons. This is not a quiet device in use, and after using a more quiet trackball it is quite noticeable.<br /><br />One important oversight is that it does not come with a battery. It takes a single AA battery, and I expected one in the box. Every other non-rechargeable pointing device I have purchased has come with a battery in the package. I am not sure why the decision was made to not include one here.<br /><br />This is a nice trackball and I will be using it quite a bit, particularly on my Linux system. It's a good size for me and so far it has worked well. It would have been nice if it was quieter when clicking, and I don't know why there was no battery in the package, but these are smaller issues. I'm pleased with this trackball.",positive,positive

B09LK7TRYV,4.0,"Most of the headphones with which I have worked have been active noise canceling (ANC) phones so I know a lot about those, but I also have other headphones too that I like. I was unaware that 3M even had headphones, and I was also unsure what their ""Quiet Space"" was all about. It's an interesting solution that works fairly well. Overall, these are good phones, though there's one area that could use some slight improvement and that's the sound profile.<br /><br />These are over-the-ear phones and they are actually quite comfortable. I like how they feel on my head - they fit snugly and I can tilt my head without losing these phones, but they don't clamp down super tight either.<br /><br />Build-wise, these are more substantial than the price suggests. I like the size adjustment in particular which is designed to last and should not fatigue with use.<br /><br />I powered these on and they quickly paired and connected to my laptop. The range is good and I was able to walk a fair distance away without losing the connection or having the sound get crackly or having it skip. With no feed coming to them they eventually powered themselves off, saving battery but potentially frustrating the wearer if this is unexpected.<br /><br />Just putting these on I was surprised by the amount of noise isolation. Without even turning these on they drastically reduced the ambient noise in the room, even effectively blocking out the sound of a running fan. I have had very few headphones that have as effective sound isolation as these, and that's a huge plus right out of the gate. The Quiet Space function adds to this, but not like ANC phones - it injects white noise into the cans so all you hear is a gentle but constant hiss that overrides most other noises. It's not deathly quiet with these on, but you won't hear most other sounds in the area when they're producing white noise. This is a very different approach to sound cancellation and it works.<br /><br />The sound profile is the one area where these phones could use a little improvement, though these are not terrible and are better than some big-name phones I have used. The bass is not overdriven but it is not muted either, and this is refreshing since most manufacturers overdrive the bass. The highs are clear, though not shrill. The midrange, however, is flat to the point that music can sound slightly hollow. It's an easy fix with an equalizer and is better than one particular big-name manufacturer's similar flaw.<br /><br />I like these phones and will be working with them more. They take a different approach to dealing with ambient noise and surrounding distractions than what ANC phones use, and they seem to work well. They're well made, comfortable and reasonably priced.",positive,positive

B00BXCDOH0,5.0,"Before this stand, I used another Fellowes one for my laptop at home, and it proved its worth--for a while. However, with my new desk setup, I needed something which I could use while changing the height and angle of my laptop screen in a way the old stand simply couldn't. I have a Unicomp keyboard and Logitech mouse which I prefer using, and my ""home"" laptop needed a better stand.<br />Enter this Lift.<br /><br />I've seen many angled laptop stands, and that's what I had in mind when I wanted to switch my old one out. Plus, my old one was better suited for the monitor at work, so I wanted to take that when I had the chance. Finally, I had the opportunity to get an angled one, so I jumped on it.<br /><br />I'm not using this stand with my laptop by itself. I'm using it as a supplemental to ""lift"" it up with my home desktop setup being my keyboard and mouse. For that, the stand works marvelously. The angle and height are just about right; I no longer have to arch my neck uncomfortably forward. Plus, I can take my old stand to work and finally have proper posture there too.<br />I can't see using this by itself. My hands would quickly become painfully uncomfortable. Heck, I can't stand using keyboards with their built-in mini stands. I honestly don't know why they're there; the angle cramps my wrists very fast.<br /><br />So for my use, I think the stand is great. There's even some empty real estate near the back to put things under, and it seems sturdy enough overall. It's currently holding my Toshiba 17"" Windows PC, which is snugly fit.",positive,positive
B00I054WFQ,5.0,"(SEE END FOR UPDATED COMPARISON TO SAMSUNG GALAXY 4)<br />I have ready many reviews on tablets, and have found most of them to be why a certain tablet is better than another to the nth degree with all kinds of technical jargon which really just pits one expert against another.  As a person who tutors people who are not technologically savvy, I am going to review this tablet from the point of view of someone who has not had one before and whether or not this is a good choice if you want to get one.<br /><br />I have been told by several business people and those who claim to be very tech savvy that they have gotten rid of their laptops except for occasional spreadsheet work in their offices or at home.  Can you get rid of your laptop by getting a tablet like this?  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS TABLET LIKE?<br />SIDE SWITCHES<br />This tablet is around the size of an ipad mini or a Kindle.  The on off switch is on the upper right hand side (with screen facing you) and below it is a rocker switch just below the power switch.  There is a space between the two buttons which will allow for elastic bands should you want to get a case for it that has them.  That will make it so that the tablet will not be turned on and off by accident.  The power button has to be pushed and held for a moment before the unit turns on.<br /><br />SCREEN<br />The tablet screen is shiny which can be annoying, but that is the nature of the beast.<br />The touch sensitivity is excellent- I did not find any problems with response time or lag.<br />The orientation changing when you turn the screen around is also well set.  It works nicely and is not overly sensitive.<br /><br />INPUT<br />To input into the tablet, you have a choice to either type or speak what you want the tablet to do.  I have to say that this tablet responds very well to either set of input.  After working with several i-pads, my daughter constantly raves about how this Acer tablet is superior in the way it responds to input with the microphone than the i-pads are.  I have not had any problem with typing into this tablet beyond what I normally do on any unit.  The microphone occasionally mistypes a word, but it is not nearly as bad as I expected it to.<br /><br />Response time of the tablet is excellent.  I am quite impressed with how quickly it responds to input without lag or difficulty.<br /><br />APPS<br />I have put a few apps on this unit which tend to be popular with tablet users.  Sketchbook Pro is one of those apps.  I really like it.  The response time is good, and the app seems to work well on this tablet.  I also love the radio app which allows you to listen to radio stations in the area or around the country.  With a case that folds into a stand, it is a great panel to use in a room where you want to listen to the radio.<br /><br />Quite a few apps that come in the tablet already are handy and easy to use.  The screen is quite intuitive and easy to use.<br /><br />INTERNET USAGE<br />This tablet is wi-fi accessible to the internet which means that you can not go out in no-man's land to use it like you can an android phone, but you have to be near a wi-fi station to use it.<br /><br />The wi-fi response time is excellent- although it does occasionally lag when the signals get weak- something that all wi-fi units will do.<br /><br />Android is a Google engine so everything you do will be monitored by Google or you will be using something they have designed to get where you want to go.  You can find other ways to purchase apps if you don't like the Google store, however, such as Amazon.<br /><br />This tablet comes with McAfee virus scan which is not a huge deal, but I am not sure how to replace that yet, should I desire to do so.<br /><br />CAMERA<br />I am not a big advocate of phone and tablet cameras.  This one has a decent camera to use on the back, and an adequate camera on the front of the camera to use for Skype which is pretty much all you need.  If you want a really nice camera, buy one.  For quick pictures to capture something you want to show someone, then this will be fine.<br /><br />PROS<br />Easy to hold<br />Screen responsive<br />Speech recognition works well<br />Good fast performance<br />Boots up quickly<br />Clear screen makes reading books nice<br />Good colors for photos on the screen (better than laptops)<br />Power button hard to accidentally turn on or off<br />Learning is pretty intuitive for first time users<br /><br />CONS<br />Wi-fi only<br />Not as easy to use as laptop for extensive typing<br />Can be a bit clumsy to use at times (the nature of tablets)<br />Start up literature is a bit underwhelming for first time users<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />CAN YOU GET RID OF YOUR LAPTOP?<br />Can you get rid of your laptop to substitute this tablet?  My answer would be no.<br /><br />Even if all you did was go on the internet to wander through web sites, using a tablet is a bit cumbersome if you want to do any kind of extensive writing.  If you use the microphone, it will probably be pretty accurate, but you will still have to use the keyboard to correct what is used.<br /><br />For occasional internet usage, watching videos, movies, and reading books, this tablet is fabulous.  I think it works beautifully.  I would say that it is just as nice as other more expensive tablets and you will invest a lot less money in it.<br /><br />If you want a tablet and do not want to pay a fortune for it, this is the way to go.  The Acer Iconia A1-830 is an excellent value and I use mine a lot.  I just could not substitute it completely for my laptop.  I prefer to have a choice in my browser, features, and fine tuning or replacement of parts should I desire to do so.<br /><br />I do find that having the tablet helps a lot when I want to quickly do something on the internet and don't want to boot up my laptop.  This tablet is pretty quick and I like it.  If you are a tech fanatic and have to have the biggest and best, you might find fault with this tablet, however.  It is worth a test run in any case.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/4/2015  SAMSUNG GALAXY 4 (8 inch) vs ACER ICONIA A1-830<br />I have had quite a chance to get to know this tablet over time and also to use a Samsung Galaxy 4 8 inch tablet in comparison both on its own and with a keyboard.  After working with both tablets, I have to say that I still prefer the Acer over the Samsung and here is why:<br /><br />-Acer has slightly smaller screen area, but is easier to work on<br />-Acer has the return and menu buttons incorporated into the screen instead of on the side so it rotates with screen<br />-Acer surface is less shiny and has less glare<br />-Performance of Acer is the same as the Samsung in terms of speed<br />-Wifi of Acer is as good as the Samsung<br />-keyboard of Acer is much easier to use than Samsung (the one in the screen)<br />-set up of the Acer is much easier and user friendly<br />-voice commands on Acer works MUCH better than on the Samsung<br />-Samsung speaker is a bit nicer than Acer, but I use a bluetooth speaker for best sound anyway.<br />-Samsung battery does last a bit longer than the Acer, but the frustrations of the Samsung still make me prefer the Acer.<br /><br />All in all, I have to say that I have tried to honestly look at both tablets and give them a fair comparison and I still like the Acer better.  The price is better and the ease of use is better too.  The microphone on the Acer seems much more responsive than the Samsung.  The screen of the Samsung is a bit more dense in terms of pixels and color perhaps, but the glare is more annoying.  I also get very irritated at the side buttons on the Samsung.  They are static (stay put) and when the tablet is on its side, it is way too easy to hit a button that screws up what I am trying to do on the Samsung.  This is especially true when I am trying to type something and is VERY frustrating.<br /><br />There is one thing about the Samsung that I really wish the Acer had and that is longer battery time.  The Samsung does run a little longer than the Acer without having to recharge.  The speaker on the Samsung is a bit nicer, but with my portable bluetooth speaker as my main source of listening, I don't find that to be a problem for me.<br /><br />So, after time and the chance to use the Acer and the Samsung so I could compare them, I still really like the Acer tablet better.  Because I do a lot of graphics work and computer work, I still would not get rid of my laptop or desktop, but I do save a lot of time using this tablet when I want to look up quick information and cruise the internet.<br /><br />UPDATE March 2016<br />I wanted to take a moment to update you concerning this device.<br /><br />As time has gone on I have enjoyed using the Acer Iconia A1-830 very much.  It is a nice tablet for an affordable price.<br /><br />HAVE I HAD PROBLEMS?<br />A few.<br />-tablet went nuts as if a baby were in charge of it and had five Redbull drinks first.  I rebooted and cleared out some programs and all was fine.<br /><br />-I could not move my information from my device to my PC- this was solved, but it has taken a lot of research, effort and time.  The support at the Acer site is rather pitiful to be honest.  That is one thing that I will say about this, is compared to Samsung, Acer does not support their devices as well as they should, but then again, the price is a lot less too.<br /><br />IS THIS STILL WORKING?<br />Yes., I use it daily and it still is working.  I keep the HD less than 60% full as I do with most devices as they tend to work best that way.  I find that it connects via wi-fi at times when other devices in the house do not.  I also find that the battery wears down a lot less quickly if I turn off location and even wi-fi if I don't need it.<br /><br />NO UPGRADE PAST KIT-KAT 4.4.2<br />There will be no upgrades to Lollipop or beyond, so if you want a more modern unit, then try for something new.<br /><br />MY REVIEW STANDS<br />I now have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 that I am using and it of course passes the Acer by a mile, but then again, it is a much more expensive machine too.",positive,positive

It also comes with a cable so you can connect it to your phone or device that way if you prefer, or if you don't have Bluetooth. The ear cups are really comfortable. The noise reduction seem really good, especially when compared to the earbuds that I was using before this. I am very pleased with how nice the sound quality is. For my purposes, it's excellent!

B005N8W1MO,4.0,"I got these on sale for under $30. Love them. but I admit I hesitate to expect a long, healthy life for them. They sound genuinely excellent (unbelievably good for the price!) and are actually very comfortable (love the fabric for the ear pieces), but the cord is super-thin and flimsy-feeling. Unless it is a lot stronger then it looks & feels, I fully expect to accidentally get up one day with it plugged into my PC and accidentally rip it out of the headphones (at this price point you do not get removeable cords). This cord is only about 1.5mm in diameter and does not inspire confidence. Cord length is fine for most uses, despite other reviews stating the contrary--it's shortish, but at about 5' it's fine for me--I use it either sitting stationary, or connected to a device I am holding or carrying in my pocket. If these headphones had a tougher/removable cord, I would be perfectly happy. Note: Sennheiser really does conquer all--these were $26 (I think) and sound better than anything else I have tried lately (including Beats--terrible), including many sets costing much, much more.",positive,negative

B0024R4B5C,4.0,"The trick with this antenna is not getting frustrated with moving it around and pointing it in the right direction. I mounted mine on the hand rail of my apartment balcony, second floor and now receive all local channels 4-68. Channel 68 being about 45 miles away. All are received in full green in windows media center, without using a preamp.<br /><br />Previously I had it mounted under and bolted to the 3rd floor balcony to try and keep it out of sight. Reception was iffy on 4 favorite channels.  I then moved it to its' present location with the idea that the antennas footprint is considerably smaller than all the satellite dishes mounted on balconies throughout the complex. The mounting bracket and pole that come with it, are the same type satellite dishes use, Very strong and versatile. You will need to buy some good bolts, I used 4, 5/16"" x 1- 1/2"" Galvanized Lag and flat washers, I predrilled 3/16"" pilot holes first. I just thought I'd mention that for those not fastener savvy.<br /><br />I would guess the antenna mount alone is worth 1/3rd of the entire antenna cost. Recommend a good quad shield coaxial cable with the thick, sollid copper wire. A shorter run is better if possible. I only have about 12 feet to my PC/TV.<br /><br />Once I figured out how to mount this antenna correctly, a month ago, I haven't had to adjust it.",positive,negative

B00P9F5THA,5.0,"I selected this keyboard/touchpad with the idea of using it with my tablet. Admittedly I mistakenly thought it was a Bluetooth keyboard which would have made it suitable for my tablet but this turned out to be a misunderstanding on my part. That said, it has proven to be a very handy keyboard in more ways than I had originally planned. In particular, in addition to working with Windows and Linux it works with Raspberry Pi which opens a whole world of possibilities for this keyboard.<br /><br />This keyboard is very small, barely bigger than a Hershey bar, and it has a full set of keys as well a touchpad and mouse buttons on the right side. This is sufficient for doing pretty much everything you’d want to do, including surfing the web, text editing and software development. Granted, the size makes it less than ideal for some of these functions but it does work as a full keyboard/mouse combination if you want to use it that way.<br /><br />Right out of the box, the switch was on and the keyboard had completely drained its battery so it had to be plugged in and charged overnight. This was a surprise but was not a big deal, just unusual.<br /><br />When connected to a Windows 8 system the OS recognized it and immediately it was usable. It required no special drivers, no configuration changes or anything else – just plug it in and turn it on. It worked the same under Linux as well.<br /><br />The real test for this keyboard/mouse was on a Raspberry Pi system. The keyboard connected and worked without a glitch – expected since it worked fine with Ubuntu Linux but not guaranteed as the kernel was known to work but the hardware was not yet tested. With a second external keyboard connected it was possible to type on both at the same time and also to use the other keyboard as a regular keyboard and the other just as a mouse.<br /><br />There are a number of other SBC types and designs out there, and there is no reason that this device should not work with any of them that have a Linux-based kernel. Embedded Windows system should also support it as well.<br /><br />Though I have not really tested the full range it is good to at least 10 feet. At that range the system still recognized input from the keyboard and touchpad without any issues.<br /><br />So far I have found only one issue with this keyboard and that’s the space bar. I habitually press the space bar in the middle, and on this keyboard the press sensors are on the ends. The spacebar is not quite stiff enough and when pressed in the middle it bows instead of pressing down on the sensors, thereby not registering the press. To get it to recognize the press I have to press on the ends specifically. This is a minor irritant and is a very small price to pay for what this device offers.<br /><br />This is a very small but fully functional keyboard/touchpad combination that works with multiple configurations. It connects easily and so far has given no real operational issues. Keep in mind that this thing is extremely small, though, which is great for portability, mobility and economy of space but less pleasant for systems that aren’t being transported anywhere.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",positive,negative

B01M1AOEDA,5.0,"We have Suddenlink cable, internet, and land line phone service and had been happy with our three year old router and their modem. Until we moved to a new house. The arris modem was dropping signal significantly every single day - we either had super slow or no connection for hours. I had the cable guys out here four times in 61 days to fix the problem. I was literally ready to just cancel Suddenlink and move to AT&amp;T for internet, but decided to try this Nighthawk combo first.<br /><br />It was spotted instantly by Suddenlink when I called to give them the new modem Mac address, so the connection was just a single phone call to start. No drama. I have 9 daily devices on WiFi and three TiVo receivers that connect via Ethernet or WiFi plus the land line phone. There's four Ethernet connections and two phone connections on the modem, plenty for our needs.<br /><br />It's been almost three weeks and I've noticed an astonishing improvement in our initial connection and reliability. Rather than daily outages, we have had five total in three weeks and none lasted more than 15 to 20 minutes. Stability of the signal has improved and our speeds are double what they were with the arris modem - we're actually getting the high speed service we pay for. The router is also projecting the WiFi far enough that I no longer need to use a secondary extender to get WiFi by the pool and patio.<br /><br />I like the Genie app with this. The ability to check channels, reboot the router if needed, and see which devices are online is very handy.  I also like the clear, bright lights on the front. At a glance you know if there's a problem. Bottom line for me is that I haven't canceled our services from Suddenlink because this unit fixed 90% of our problem.",positive,positive

B004F9QOHU,1.0,"Back in November 2015, I purchased this used AMD 1065T from M&amp;D.  I installed it a few days later (Nov. 7) and it had been working fine since that time until July 12, 2016.  Then it failed suddenly, no BSOD, nothing.  Hoping that it was my five year old power supply, I replaced that with a new one.  No joy.  Today, I replaced the 1065T from M&amp;D with the 925 that I had replaced with the 1065T.  My system started up with no problems, so it is definitely the case that the 1065T from M&amp;D has failed.<br /><br />I should say, given the nature of these devices, how they are used, etc. that I don't and didn't overclock this device.  But given the sudden failure of this CPU, my bet is that a previous user did overclock it. My experience with AMD and Intel CPUs (all new) has been that properly installed and used, they don't fail.  I did not expect that a used CPU would fail at 7 months of use.<br /><br />I did not make use of Amazon's two year protection plan, more the fool I.

Unfortunately, the used market is the only way you can get one of these CPUs, now.  If you're not willing to kiss your money and effort goodbye in a few months, get Amazon's protection plan, because M&amp;D will not help you at all after thirty days.

I gave the flash drive three stars because it is cumbersome to connect to the lightning connector of the IPad if the IPad is in a cover.  The lightning connection on the Drive needs to be a little longer.  You have to remember that the flash drive has to be charged up to use it with the IPad. The IPad battery seems to deplete a lot quicker when using the flash drive. Just discovered there is a limit on the size of a PDF document you can open with the SanDisk software.

B011HVUEME,5.0,"This is a VERY cool device.  Packaged with the antenna variety pack provides out-the-box reception across a broad range of frequencies supported by this software defined receiver.  Following the quick start instructions on the rtl-sdr blog web site, I was up and running with a Windows 10 laptop in under 10 minutes.  I played with the thing for an hour straight!  So many neat features, and I've only scratched the surface with lots more to learn.  Great for visualization and spotting frequencies with signals, much faster than scanning for frequencies on my handy-talkie.  Great for beginners (no HAM license required since it's receive only, no transmit) and great for licensed HAMs looking to broaden their view across a wider world of RF.",positive,positive
B08Z41RGQL,5.0,"I personally do not like the trend of airpods/earbuds, I find them to be uncomfortable. So I am glad that some companies are still making quality standard headphones, with wireless.<br />EASY TO CONNECT - my phone and computer found the device, labelled ""B12"" in bluetooth and had no issues connecting it up.<br />SOUND QUALITY - sound is great, with rich full bass. The noise cancelling works almost too well, as my daughter was using them and could not hear a thing I was saying<br />COMFORT - solid design, comfortable, does not pinch<br /><br />Great headphones, would buy again!",positive,positive
B06XFNQGTL,2.0,"I had these speakers installed into the rear doors powered by the ct sounds 120x4 amp. I also had a pair of Meso 5.25 originally for the back doors and they also blow the surround then started that irritating rattling sound. I can't do the work myself because I had back surgery recently after being send back home from overseas serving this nation. . I can't be bending and twisting BUT I need my sound. I know the plandemic has lowered the attitudes of a lot of workers and that could be the reason for the lowered or POOR quality. I do need this item replaced as soon as possible. I NEED MY SOUND ct!<br /><br />I had Bose in my Audi S8 but I ripped that trash out of my car. I wanted a clear up grade. I originally wanted a full ct sounds system in my S8 with 2 12""""EXO 2ohm Subwoofers and the amps reccommended for powering them I was thinking it would be the TEAM 7K.1 but they're nowhere to be found. I just didn't want to put a lot mix of different brands in my S8.

B01F8GS8M2,2.0,Bad Call Quality<br />Call quality is not good at all on these Samsung headphones. Other party barely can hear you. I wouldn't recommend it if you are trying to use it for making phone calls. My regular headphones which came with my S7 phone work much better for phone calls. The reason I bought these so I could use it's noise cancellation along with calling feature. Because I am a frequent flyer and fly every other week. But Its active noise cancellation feature is just OK but not really worth the price.,negative,negative
B09TP1XDL2,4.0,"This must be assembled from a handful of smaller pieces.. reviewing instructions and using common sense will help a lot. I DO suggest the buddy system when setting up for sure- it makes the process so much easier! It also ensures being careful not to crease the screen.. Just note- sizes may not sound big when ordering but, I was surprised just how big 120 size screen really was!!! (Maths never been my strong point- so maybe this was just me.. but a quick size reference before ordering will give you some real time idea!)<br /><br />Used indoors- we didn’t need water weights.. but have if/when necessary. Not sure how easy they’ll be to use if using on a camp out… Water can be sparse- I’d probably weight down with sandbag or cinder block?<br /><br />If following instructions it’s a bit contradicting to state… “Do not fold or roll screen.” To store in the provided carry bag- The only way to fit the screen in is to roll..?? Carefully doing so, we blindly followed and hoping it won’t cause any issues- I wish it provided more clarity in this department!<br /><br />As for screen itself.. just be sure to eliminate any light source from behind it since it can offset the picture from projector light on front side. Doing this gives a solid image… It’s awesome! Used at our teen sons bday party with group of friends- we set up big screen in our game room and all had a solid view of movie marathon- zero complaints.. a huge node from a picky crowd!<br /><br />Overall, as our 1st screen purchase.. it was so much better then using the wall or a sheet tacked up like we have! You cant believe how much it enhances the picture. I do wish screen protection was better and a few less pieces to build (capable for younger crowd to set up..) Otherwise, it’s ideal. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend- hoping info can help your decision.. stay safe everyone.",positive,positive

Now everything is all in one spot, and I don't have to search for anything. I even have my wireless phone charger plugged into it both at home and at work.<br /> I have connected to it my wireless mouse,my wireless charging pad, my headphones, my external storage that has my music on it.( I do take back and forth to work).

B07WMTLW2R,5.0,"This is a terrific monitor that is going to make my work day a lot easier. First of all at 27 inches it is huge. I included a picture to show you how much bigger the monitor is than a typical laptop screen. Also, the monitor does not have the glare that is created by my laptop screen. It's like the difference between a matte finish and a glossy finish on a paperback. The glossy finish starts to tire your eyes at the end of the day, and the matte finish keeps you fresh. I'm finding I don't have to take as many eye breaks with this new monitor.<br /><br />Installation is easy. The stand is solid and goes together without any tools. The TV also locks into the stand with no tools and has both a vertical and a tilt adjustment. There is a set of control keys along the side that allow you to make adjustments to the picture. I turned down the brightness to try to match the screen of my laptop. It came with a VGA cable, an audio cable, and a power cable. There is a HDMI plug in the back, but no HDMI cable was included with the purchase price.<br /><br />Note that you have to use the button on the side of the monitor to turn it on, not the switch located next to the power cable. This is a very nice monitor.",positive,positive
B07PGR1KF8,3.0,"When my much more expensive Bluetooth on-ear headphones broke I was a bit frustrated and decided to go back to something cheaper.  As expected, this product is less comfortable and clearly uses cheaper materials and construction, but I can't really complain given the price.  The sound quality is fine as far as I can tell. The battery life is decent but noticeably shorter than my previous headphones.  Also, the low battery warning is a very annoying loud series of beeps that repeats periodically until you charge it.  So if you just want to listen for 5 more minutes or get through the last couple of minutes of that video and then charge it, well too bad, because the beeps are going to annoy the **** out of you until you charge it.  Also, the pictures in the instructions were not clear to me at all, and it took me a while to find the charging port (you have to tilt one of the earphones to reveal the port which is otherwise hidden behind the headband).<br /><br />Also, unlike my previous headphones, this one does not work well with my tablet's media volume sync (when the headphones are turned on they always revert to a default volume, they don't remember the last volume used), so I had to turn sync off to avoid constantly having to recalibrate the volume of the headset relative to the tablet.",positive,negative

If you're like me and have a bad recollection of the early days -- with the flaky connectivity and the terrible, tinny sound -- you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Build quality feels pretty decent for the price; comfortable; buttons are easy to find with the headset on, and I've been putting them on while taking public transit, without playing anything, just so I can concentrate on reading, and not the prattle.<br /><br />So, thumbs up.

B00FJGGIEC,5.0,"Looks like I have the privilege of being the first person to review the BA M25 speakers. I picked up a pair of these on Christmas Eve and have been playing them constantly over the past 2 weeks. My focus has been on 2 channel stereo recordings instead of movies. My set up is through an older Denon AVR 610 receiver that I have had for almost 20 years. I was initially impressed with the smooth, balanced feel of these speakers. Good mid range, nice high end, but not too bright, and a very strong bass response. The M25s defy their size in producing bass tones. Give them some break in time before making a final assessment. These speakers excel at producing music performed on real instruments. The do a great job on jazz, blues and acoustic folk styles of music. Vocals come across nicely as well.<br />Boz Scaggs ""But Beautiful"" CD of standards sounds great. Upright bass, piano and vocals make you feel like you are in a small jazz club. Diana Krall ""Live in Paris"" also plays very well. Nice piano, guitar & vocal reproduction. Jorma Kaukonen's ""Blue Country Heart"" CD showcases some great finger style acoustic guitar. Very natural acoustic guitar tones. Linda Ronstadt's ""Winter Light"" CD has some of the most powerful vocals you will ever hear and the M25s reproduce Linda's voice and backing instrumentation extremely well. The sound is never strained or harsh. Initially, I was a bit more apprehensive on some CDs with lots of bass. They sounded like they were trying to overcompensate on bass, but this has evened out over the past week. Eric Clapton's ""Pilgrim"" CD has come serious bottom end and the M25s produce very deep, tight bass response. Peter Gabriel ""So"" is a similar story. Deep, tight bass response that does not bottom out. Paul Rogers ""Muddy Waters Blues"" is a treat on the M25s. The opening track features some acoustic delta blues guitar, followed by a chorus of female backup singers and later some nice Strat blues guitar tones. It all sounds great on these speakers.<br />The look and finish on the speakers is impressive also. They are finished in a polished black exterior with a leatherette finish on the top, back & bottom. They look like a piece of fine furniture that would fit into a modern style of home décor. These speakers are very expensive though. I got a demo pair at less than half of the $399 per speaker list price. I don't think I would have bought them at full price. I have been listening to Boston Acoustics speakers for over 20 years. I still own a pair of A60s and a pair of A120s that have served me well over the years. The M25s have replaced the A120s as my primary speakers in my living room due to their sonic capabilities and their stylistic good looks.<br /><br />Update 6/24/14 - After listening to these speakers for 6 months, I continue to be even more impressed by the Boston M25s. I bought these thinking they will do until I can find better. While there are better speakers out there, I have concluded, after many demo sessions, that I would need to spend at least $1500-$1800 or more to get some form of improvement over the M25s. Short of stepping up to KEF R300 @ $1800, B&W CM5 @ $1500 or Aperion Verus Towers, the M25s deliver the goods with very balanced & neutral sound, great detail in the upper register and sold bass. Highly recommended.",positive,positive
B0098QUW1E,2.0,"This case is NOT what I expected. Packaging was horrible to begin with. Upon opening the plastic bag was beat up and all the Silica gel beads that keeps dampness away was all busted. I had to rush to the trash can to prevent beads from falling onto the ground where my pets walk.<br /><br />Now to the case... THE MOST P.O.S. case I have ever seen or felt!!!! Once you get past the manufacture packaging it comes out all flimsy and oversized!! I placed the latest Samsung Note 10.1 into it.  The expandable teeny cords hold the device in but the cover is what makes it freaking flimsy. It's the part that is way oversized and over laps my device and does not even come close to auto- shut off. The cover is so overly sized ( way too much room between device and cover) that even the magnetic closure does not work or doesn't line up. I should also note that they must have used a very cheap magnet because it does not &#34;lock on&#34; to front cover.<br /><br />All I can say is that if you hold the device by hand the cover dangles pretty bad. In addition to my complaint the cover is also used as the part to help your device stand hands free.  But... upon laying the cover down and setting it up, you can see the cardboard bend down and not flat on the surface. Perhaps a tougher cardboard and proper dimension sizing for devices would work much better.<br /><br />For the price...use your money towards a stronger cover/case that offers the same features. I do NOT recommend this.",negative,negative

I realize that everyone has different tastes, so this is only one mans opinion....<br />UPDATE:  I have changed my original 2 star rating to 4 stars.  Reason being I was originally not happy when connected to my computer.  But I purchased an Amazon Dot and now I am pleased with the bass response of these units.

I'm watching another video right now and the image is grainy while the audio is tinny. Photos taken with the built in camera are also very grainy and poor quality. If you need a cheap tablet and have low expectations for it, this might work.

The plastic is thin and feels fragile. These are the very definition of Basics in AmazonBasics. They're a little small so if you have a big head they might be a bit uncomfortable. The padding on the ear cups is okay the stuff on the frame less so. Sound quality is. . . Basic, highs are flat, bass is muddy. These headphones aren't premium equipment and they don't pretend to be.

B0748G1QLP,2.0,"I found Bose's latest wireless headphones to be a fairly serious disappointment, which was surprising and frustrating after having bought 5 or 6 pairs of headphones over the years, along with speakers and a Wave Radio.  I *like* Bose products.<br /><br />Let me start with the positive, to be fair.<br /><br />1. They sound great.<br />2. They stay in my ears.  (A feature Apple did not think to include with their glorious AirPods.)<br />3. The Bose connect app on the iPhone is slick and useful.<br /><br />The negatives.<br /><br />1. They are very big and jut from my ears in a way that looks comical.  I've seen other people compare them to the bolts on Frankenstein's neck, but for the ears.  Actually, though, it's worse than that, because their weight makes them droop.  So I'd describe the look as more Frankenstein Eeyore.  If you have hair that covers your ears, you will probably be ok.  But I am close to bald, so I can't really wear them in public.  Since I bought them to wear during my workouts at LA Fitness and while coding at work, the fact that they make me look silly is a show stopper.<br /><br />2. Given the look issues, I'd love to wear them when I listen to music on my computer at home, but they don't pair properly with Windows 10.  They have a voice profile and a music profile.  No matter how I fiddle with my PC, based on advice from the various threads on Bose's support forums, I cannot get the music profile to activate.  The reason this is a problem is that the voice profile only plays music in one ear, and at far reduced quality.  Like it's-being-piped-to-your-ear-through-Satan's-toilet quality.  Bose's suppport forums have various threads about this, and it's clear that some part of Bose's software group either doesn't get it or is trying to avoid publicly stating that they can't fix the problem.  They claim it is Windows or software differences on various PCs, but my Apple AirPods work fine as do Bose's SoundSport Wireless headphones (though they lack a mic, so the scenario is somewhat different).<br /><br />3. I wish there was a way to hear audio in both ears while making calls.  You can do this with the AirPods.",negative,negative
B09RQ955CB,5.0,"These are a great set of buds fore the price. I've tried dozens of ear buds over the years. How do these rate? I think for the price (Currently $43) they are an easy 5 stars. The sound is the best I've heard for the size of them and they are some of the smallest wireless buds I've tried. The noise cancelation (Which I'm not a big fan of because I use to work out and need to hear a bit of what going on around me) works well. They are a bit awkward to get out of the case bit it's not a big issue. Back tot he audio quality, the bass is someway lacking but for certain songs it actually works better than my AirPods especially if you seal them in your ears well. I can run in these fine without them falling out. Overall very pleased with these and the look pretty cool.",positive,positive

B019SVR2B6,3.0,"Ive been doing alot of reviews on vr headset so i figured i might as well buy a controller to make it easier. Upon unboxing this controller you find the controller and a set of instructions in english and chinese. The instructions arent the easiest to follow but they manage to be specific just enough to get the controller connected through bluetooth. the controller has 2 modes, a key and game mode. The best i can tell is it changes the layout of buttons and the instructions actually state that you change from vertically holding it (key mode) to horizontally holding it (game mode).<br /><br />Upon using it i have not experienced any problems with it, no bad connections, no lag ETC. The hardest part is remembering which key is for which function (not labeled on the controller)",positive,negative

B01J94T4R2,5.0,"I guess I'm a little bit of a Fire-omaniac in that I own 3 different Fire tablets; an old 7&#34; that I use primarily to play solitare; a 10&#34; that I use with a keyboard as a small laptop and now this New 8&#34; Fire HD.  I traded in a Fire 6&#34; for this .  The 6&#34; , I felt was just a little small. It's amazing what an extra 2&#34; can do!  This Fire fits perfectly in the murse that I bought in Italy last year.<br />So much for fashion, but how does it perform?  Well, the screen definition is bright, sharp and clear. I LOVE the Blue Shade feature for night time reading in bed. I'm impressed with the audio quality of the two small speakers. As a professional musician, sound quality is important to me.  The option of using an SD card for extra storage of music and photos is also a valuable asset.<br />The tablet responds very quickly, is easy to navigate and simple to use. I bought it for travel but find myself using it at home in place of my laptop.<br />The only slightly disappointing feature are the on-board cameras.  The photos are a little grainy.<br />All in all, it's a great tablet. My wife likes it so much that she wants one as a substitute for her iPad.",positive,positive

B004TPJKEY,3.0,"First the disclaimer that I got this in the Vine program. That being said, I always try to be fair, honest and objective in my reviews. That being said, I am a little disappointed in this Sharp system. As the ad specified this was good for small spaces, I set it up in my bedroom (as I have a 32"" Samsung flatscreen there with no additional sound support). Here are the pros: Set up was not difficult (although it did take me close to an hour to do by myself with the instructions). Sound is clear, bass tones are adjustable and I found the overall quality sufficient for a small/medium sized room. Here are the cons: First, as another reviewer has written, the fan in the bass unit is audible. Make sure you set it somewhere further enough away from where you are sitting or you will be distracted (regardless of how loud you set the speaker) by the hum. The other thing I wish Sharp would have done is make this a wireless device. I think this is why it took me so long to set it up trying to hide/wind the wires inside the carpeting so as not to be seen. To me, wireless is the way to go particularly with a sound system. I actually had bought another unit for a set up in my den http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MME6S4/ref=wms_ohs_product which is a Panasonic. Cost half the price of this unit and I honestly prefer it over the Sharp. Shop around, this is overpriced for what you can get elsewhere.",positive,negative

B07VY39B2Y,5.0,"[[VIDEOID:331807d8d8d087a6f9d617912336adb7]] I ordered this ‘Deity V-Mic D3 Pro High SNR Super-Cardioid Directional Shotgun Microphone with Rycote Shockmount for DSLRs, Camcorders, Smartphones, Tablets, Handy Recorders, Laptop，Bodypack Transmitters, Wind Shield’ for review.<br />Let me start by saying that I have never owned an external camera mic as I never really had much use for one until recently, so I don’t have anything to compare this one too other than the on board built-in mic from my Canon 60D. When I first received the D3 Pro I was totally blown away by what looked, and felt like a quality device. The included hard case is really nice (see attached images) as is the included Deadcat or Wind Muff, although it is a bit tricky to install as it fits so snug. The difference between the onboard built-in mic and the D3 Pro is like night and day (see attached sound check video). In the video I state that I have the “Volume” on the mic set to 4 and it’s actually called the “Gain” control which was actually set to 5. Even in the slightly breezy conditions during the outside test I did not use the LCF or Low-Cut Filter, which can reduce light wind noise. The Mic has LCF settings for 75Hz, 150Hz and Off. The D3 Pro also has a built in rechargeable battery via the USB C port on the side which is nice and much appreciated. I don’t want to carry around extra batteries and these days I much prefer USB C charging on newer devices. I can’t really report on the battery life as of yet, because I have only done a few short video sessions and have yet charged it since the initial full charge once I got it.<br />Overall I am really impressed with this D3 Pro and feel like this has absolute value for the price and I highly recommend it.",positive,positive
B079QX11HQ,4.0,"Edit 11-20-2018<br /><br />Mobile app iOS,<br /><br />I noticed as some others have that I was unable to see a camera remotely yesterday. I had previously setup and tested the app with just 3 cameras. Nothing would bring the new cameras into view. Well almost nothing, I removed the app from the phone and reinstalled it, now all cameras are showing remotely.<br /><br />Original :<br />I was a low voltage installer in years gone by and this brought back memories of why I no longer like crawling in attics at this age. Seriously though the unit is superb. Its not that bad of an install, its just me hating crawling in attics after having done it for so many years.<br /><br />It came packaged really well.  I was surprised at how well it was protected. We purchased the 16 channel NVR for future expandability. I put cameras all over the place. They are arranged to keep track of important areas as you would expect. The image is great. Better than I had hoped for.<br /><br />The cables are not really internet ready, each cable only has 4 wires in it. I would rather have had a fully functional cable.<br />Upon taking the DVR out of the box, there was a small rattle inside, more of a piece of plastic moving around. Like a broken tab during assemble.<br /><br />Installation activities.<br /><br />The cables also a little short for larger homes, though they do sell longer versions. In most of my use cases the cables were fine. It's just 3 were all the way across the home in a far corner. I could have used another 10'.<br />So, I simple ran my own cable and terminated the ends. No big deal for me. However if you think you'll have enough and your getting close in your estimation, you better have one or two longer ones. The 60' cables seem to be a standard in the security camera kits.<br /><br />The cable protector/environmental protection covers are a little large, not overly so. Just notating it here for others. You'll need to make sure you have extra room behind the camera. Most people will not see this issue. Make sure and use a drill bit big enough for the protector to pass though if it will be placed inside a wall, or overhang etc. You are not just drilling a hole for the cable. Look at the camera and you'll see the size you need to make it. I also ended up needing a longer HDMI cable, the one that came with this was about 6' I needed a 10' due to my particular situation. Not a mfg. fault, just my use case. So this one went into the spare bin and one in a 10/12' came out.<br /><br />The first day, I needed to arrange things in my AV closet, and add a plugin. You may wish to have a licensed electrician preform this, if it's needed.<br /><br />We started about 1 pm and finished about 7 putting in the NVR, 3 cameras, pulling 3 new wires, terminating those wires. The second day we started at 9 am and finished at 8 PM, with the remaining cameras. Though we had some extremely challenging placements this day. Your install time may or may not be this long, or it could possibly be longer.<br /><br />Use :<br /><br />As to the cameras they work really well, I was surprised at how well the picture looks and the microphone, well its as another user put it almost too good. You can go into settings and turn down the volume., Make sure you do that for cameras that are internal, aka in the house. If you using a monitor it may not be necessary that much. But ours is piped into the living room tv, and the kids or I, leave the volume up. You'll clearly know it when you switch over to the camera system and click on the camera.<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />For anyone looking for answers here its also a good bet to look at the Swann forums. There are some good topics from other users there as well. Especially for users who may be asking more technical or unique issues. For anyone looking at this I would suggest also looking at some youtube videos there are a few that go over some of the options in the NVR settings. Like setting recording limits etc. Motion detection and so forth.<br /><br />End results / Opinion:<br /><br />I am more than pleased with my purchase, it far lives up to my desires. I wish I had bit the bullet and done this earlier on. Like years ago, but oh well its up now and I am more than happy. It's a little large purchase, money wise. But I personally think it was well worth the money at least for us.<br /><br />This replaced a wireless competitor and its leaps and bounds above it.",positive,negative
B003ELYQGG,4.0,"I like having a pair of wired headphones in the house, nice to not worry about having to charge your headphones. I was purposely looking for headphones that are more flat on the outer part, so it makes it a little more comfortable to sleep with, and also use with multiple devices. Not expecting much in the way of sound, often the wired headphones have more treble and are usually good for audiobooks, or voice, more than music. I hooked these up with an adapter for a couple of different tablets, phone, and laptop. They sounded different on different devices, makes sense, so my phone, wow awesome bass, in a wired headphone? Okay, cool, and on my tablets with turning off my equalizer, the sound was crisp and clear and still had some bass, but great too for podcasts. I like how snug these fit in the ear, but I changed out the little plastic ear covers for some others I have, and I have to say, that snug fit makes them much better with more noise being filtered out. The longer cord is good too. So surprised how good these sound, and for the price, good deal.",positive,positive
B002DP1FTU,5.0,"Except for the long connecting wire, these headphones work well in the gym.  You need to wrap the long wire, and tape it, then keep in your gym shorts while exercising.  After that, they work well.  They do not get smelly or loose quality if worn frequently in the gym.  And, the light weight design works well with any exercise.  As for use as a studio headphone, maybe not so great.  They keep out noise, but due to their design, do not have enough padding to keep out high level noise.  Again, at the gym, that is good, so your buddy can get your attention.<br /><br />My rating would be a two star if used by somebody serious in the music industry.  For my use, it has worked just fine in the gym (except for the cable wire being too long.)",positive,positive

B00CDGSOHU,5.0,"I did a LOT of research before purchasing this little speaker.  My needs were pretty simple:  I wanted a wireless speaker that could connect with either my iPhone or iPad to use on the nightstand.  I like to play music before I go to sleep, so it needed to be small, but have great sound.<br /><br />Based on the reviews here, I finally decided on this one, and I'm happy to say it's PERFECT!<br /><br />It charged quickly connected to my MacBook Pro -- about 2 hrs, maybe a little less.  Turned it on, turned on the iPhone, went to the ""Settings"" on the phone, found Bluetooth, and there was the JAM XT.  Selected it, and voila! they paired.  Entire set-up took about 10 seconds.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of classical music, so my first ""test"" was the Brahms ""A German Requiem"" -- lots of highs, lows, soft, loud, etc.  Strings, voices, woodwinds, brass -- it's all in there.  I listened carefully for distortion -- everything was set on ""medium"" volume -- and I'm happy to say I heard NO distortion at all.  Everything sounded great -- nearly as good as my Bose system, but without the bass resonance.<br /><br />OK, so I haven't had this very long (about a week), so its durability remains to be seen.  But I'm impressed with the quality and style of this.  If I notice any issues, I'll update this review.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I can now fall asleep to great sounding music from a small-footprint speaker.  And that's exactly what I wanted.",positive,negative
B07HJD18HY,5.0,"We had some trouble finding a radio that can be used for our 2008 Honda Fit, we just wanted to add USB, a clock and bluetooth and tried out 2 before we found this one. The issue is, once you remove the factory radio, the clock is gone as well, so the radio had to be customizeable to show a clock too. This was almost the hardest part, find a radio that does show the clock if you want to, so for the price, it is a awesome model.<br /><br />It is easy to install thanks to multiple videos online and the functionality is pretty decent. This is not an orignal factory radio, so they had to cram in a lot of items into a small space.

B00M48532Q,4.0,"I received this as a free review sample five months ago and have been using it for around four months. This is a rear view monitor only - not a dashcam - and it works far better than one of the combination rear monitors/dashcams that I have also used.<br /><br />Since there are a large number of reviews that cover this in detail I am going to keep mine brief. Here is the single thing I do not like about it: the terrible documentation. On the other hand you can have this professionally installed for not a lot of money, which is the route that I took. If you are a do-it-yourselfer installing it right is less than an hour job (according to the tech who installed mine).<br /><br />What I love is the clear visual behind me. The camera works in dark and low light, and the display has sufficient clarity and resolution to easily see what is behind you and estimate distances. If you were to purchase this as an option on a vehicle I shudder to think of the cost, but for less than one hundred fifty bucks professionally installed this is a bargain. And if you do install it yourself you can knock a C-note off that cost.<br /><br />If you parallel park frequently this is a perfect way to make that easier.

It has a lot of tacking stitches and reinforcement stitching on it.<br /><br />CAPACITY<br />This has great pockets and storage.  It expands a lot to hold many things.  The inside back has padding to keep things from poking through to the back.  The main compartment is large enough to hold a LOT of books or other things.  It has a small zipper compartment to hold keys, change, cards, etc.<br /><br />FRONT POCKETS/COMPARTMENTS<br />The front compartments are very nice and large.  The first one is quite deep and will hold small notebooks, pads, and other smaller things- but it is fairly deep so it will hold a lot.<br /><br />The next front compartment has a pleated angled pocket which will hold quite a bit too.  There is a small zipper compartment above that (all of these on the outside easily accessed) that holds small items and will even hold a phone.<br /><br />SIDES<br />The sides have elastic pockets on them which will hold bottled water or other things you might need to stick in there.<br /><br />LOOPS<br />There is a band of loops which you can use to put things through or hook them to.<br /><br />SIDE BANDS<br />There are bands on the side which are adjustable that you can use to pull in the backpack if it is not full so it does not stick out so far.<br /><br />SHOULDER STRAPS<br />The shoulder straps are padded and comfortable.<br /><br />WAIST STRAP<br />The waist strap has pockets on each side which are shaped like fanny packs.  They zip shut and hold many things too.<br /><br />ROLL STRAPS<br />At the top of the shoulder straps are two straps that are adjustable that you can use to put a bedroll or other similar object.  We have also used it for a tripod for camera.<br /><br />ZIPPER QUALITY<br />The zippers on this are very nice quality and heavy duty looking.<br /><br />WATER REPELLANT?<br />This seems water repellant, but I have not had it out in a pouring rain storm yet, so I can not report on that kind of water.  It would not hurt to spray this with water proof spray like you get for camping equipment just to be safe.<br /><br />OVER ALL PERFORMANCE<br />Whoever designed this, really thought it out well.  I am VERY impressed with the way it is set up and how it works when on my back.  We all like this one and it gets a lot of use.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Well designed and thought out, this backpack will give a lot of storage room if you need it, or you can adjust it for lighter loads too.

B0745JLDR1,5.0,"Most of my experience with Logitech products has been with keyboards and mice, though the company has made products in other segments as well, such as video surveillance systems and Modula-2 compilers. This is the first set of Logitech speakers I have tried and used, and I was expecting them to be a solid mid-range offering. They’ve proven to be better than that.<br /><br />These speakers are not very large, about as big around as the lid on a container of oatmeal. They’re heavy, though, and in addition to the main speaker they have a bass subwoofer on each. They feel very solid and should hold up under some abuse shy of being dropped on a concrete surface.<br /><br />My first test was to connect them to my phone via Bluetooth. I plugged them in, turned them on and they immediately started broadcasting their ID. My phone immediately saw them and I was able to pair and connect them without any issue at all. Based on my experience there, the Bluetooth connectivity is excellent. I later tried to connect them to my computer by the audio cable – simple and easy as should be expected.<br /><br />The main question when using a set of speakers – how do they sound? In a word: excellent. The bass response is solid but not overdriven, the midrange is warm and has good depth, and the highs are sharp and clear without being shrill. I was expecting a more subdued sound profile, but Logitech did a good job with getting these to sound great. I would stop short of calling these audiophile quality, but the large majority of users should be happy.<br /><br />I bumped up the volume and tried to get these to distort and I was unsuccessful. They remained clear even through the full volume range. I set them in the kitchen, turned up the volume and went to the basement as I was still able to hear the sound clearly – through the ceiling.<br /><br />I do have speakers that sound better by a little bit, but they cost three times as much and they’re quite a bit larger. Considering the price point and the size of these speakers, these are much better than one could realistically expect.",positive,positive

The basic setup took me less than 5 minutes, even though I had zero prior experience using a Bluetooth headset paired with a cellphone.  And in under 15 minutes, I had voice dialing activated (a feature that depends on your phone), so that I could use the headset to place and end calls with voice commands transmitted to my phone (a Samsung Galaxy S4).<br /><br />My Jabra Stealth headset seemed to need a brief charge (a USB/MicroB cable is included) prior to accomplishing a Bluetooth pairing.  However, I may not have been pressing the Answer/End phone call button correctly at first, to activate pairing--the ""button"" is actually a long silver piece with mic holes, that moves up and down when you press the ""Jabra"" marking.  Once the flashing Bluetooth indicator light appeared, my phone found the Jabra headset immediately, paired with it, and connected.  I can also use NFC to quickly connect my phone with the headset.<br /><br />The headset charges completely in about two hours, which gives you about six hours of talk time.  Once it's even partially charged, a pleasant female voice announces how much talk time is available when you turn the headset on.  The headset is so lightweight, it's barely noticeable when you're wearing it.  You do want to experiment a little with the included selection of ear gels and ear hooks, to find the one that fits your ear most comfortably.  You can wear this headset in either the right or left ear.<br /><br />I would recommend visiting the Jabra Stealth web site, to watch a short instructional video, look over the FAQs, and download the Jabra Stealth User Manual (a .pdf file).  The .pdf manual is slightly more complete than the Getting Started guide, and has an additional section on ""Handling Multiple Calls"" (you can place a call on hold).  The FAQs tell you how to set up the Jabra Stealth headset to work with two different mobile devices (but only one device will be able to use voice-activated dialing).<br /><br />I like this headset a lot, and plan to use it for answering calls handsfree when I'm driving. The sound quality is very good.  You have to use the volume controls on your mobile phone, because there are none on the headset itself, but I'm happy enough with that tradeoff in return for such a small, lightweight headset.",positive,negative
B00C27S0M4,5.0,"I already have a Bose system (worth about $1500) that I use in my living room. I was looking for a system for use in my family room with a new 3D television I had bought around Super Bowl time. I got the Sony BDV-N7100W system and I can honestly say that at about a third of the price of the Bose, the Sony excels with sound quality. I love the wireless speakers and have them spread out over about a 25 ft. area. The sound is incredible with strong lows and highs. The 3D Blu-ray player is also flawless in quality and completes my home theater system to a T. My teenage sons absolutely love this system and are spending more time now in the family room than the living room (solely for the reason on using the Sony). For the price, this Sony system can not be beat. The quality is wonderful, it's attractive and compact. Not a bad thing to say about the system, go for it.",positive,positive
B085XSRGPV,2.0,"Let's get one thing straight right away: THESE ARE NOT SUNGLASSES.  They are blue-light blocking at best, or just mildly tinted most likely. I took them out of the box and thought ""Oh cool! These are the kinds of glasses that get dark outside and transparent when you are inside!"", but nope- I wore them for a full hour outside and they didn't get any darker or exhibit any sun blocking properties AT ALL. So that's false advertising right there. They aren't for use in the sun. They don't darken anything.<br />As far as audio quality... they are a cool concept, but again, falls short of expectations. The open ear design means the speakers have to work harder to be audible. That means they often make those tin-sounding rattles that tiny speakers make when cranked up too high. This is definitely NOT cool for music as most of the fidelity is lost right off the bat, and adding insult to injury is that they often don't get loud enough to use outside. I'm not saying using it in a crowded subway terminal (that you can just forget about completely), I'm talking about even just going for a stroll around my suburban block with some birds chirping and the wind blowing lightly, maybe a car driving in the distance. I tried listening to a recorded lecture (since music was a lost cause), and they couldn't get loud enough to hear clearly. The microphone for calls was OK in my test, so I guess they are cool as a way to take a phone call without wearing a headset, but that only works if you're wearing these anyway as sunglasses. They aren't sunglasses, so you wouldn't be wearing them anyway, and you wouldn't be wearing them for music, and you wouldn't be wearing them to make a phone call either because they rarely get loud enough unless you are home alone... in which case you can put your phone on speaker and avoid this whole mess.<br />In conclusion- its a good idea but executed poorly and does NOT live up to expectations. I'm surprised there are so many good reviews on this product. I can't think of a time I would use it.",negative,negative
B00DQFGJR4,4.0,"This is a good usb hub. It is compact, so naturally it is a bit difficult to add more devices.

B08XVYZ1Y5,1.0,"We have replaced several of these for the same issue. It just recently started happening to us, though. The audio and video will not sync up properly. So we hear something, but it is not in time with the video. So we either hear their voice and then the mouth moves, or the mouth moves and then we hear the voice. We have tried to sync them manually following instructions given by the support team and what we found online. It isn't perfect, but it is better. After a little while, it is VERY noticeable again. It is not limited to one application, either. We have seen it happen on Prime Video and YouTube TV. I have not had these issues using our Smart TVs. Since it works fine on Smart TVs, and since it is not just one application, the FireStick TV Stick 4k is the last remaining culprit.<br /><br />When we used Hulu+, it would just kick us out or lag forever. Did not have as many issues with that when I used either a Smart TV or my PS4. Just a horrible product. I am going to try to get Rokus for my other TVs and see if that helps at all.<br /><br />I did not use Alexa or voice commands very often, so I do not have a large sample size, but it seems to work fairly well for those types of functions.",negative,negative

B00CX5P8FC,4.0,"It's small, smaller than I expected. The remote is small, light, and easy to handle. Picture quality is outstanding, as you would expect. The voice search feature works beautifully, and as of now has recognized perfectly everything I've said to it. Very nicely done, Amazon.<br /><br />The out-of-box presentation is elegant. You have to connect the power adaptor, and the HDMI cable to your TV. (That means, your HDTV.) You have to put the 2 batteries (included) into the remote, and then turn it on. Configure it for your WiFi Internet connection, and you're good to go. Amazon has already thoughtfully registered the device to your Amazon account, so there's absolutely no additional setup necessary.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars, and not 5? Well, the Roku gets 5 stars because of the many dozens of additional channel options with the Roku. However, all your favorites are here on the Amazon Fire, including Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, for example.<br /><br />Should you get the Roku vs. the Amazon Fire? You'll probably be happy with either, especially if you don't think you would bother with all the additional channels available with Roku. For the usual things, the two are essentially identical. If you need a wired Ethernet network connection, there is a Roku model with that, and the Amazon Fire (like many other boxes) uses only WiFi. However, the Amazon has the nifty voice search feature, which is a clear improvement over Roku. (And I've been a Roku fan since it first came out.)",positive,positive

B093SL1W2H,5.0,"OK, so I waited awhile before purchasing my first pair of earbuds.

They seem to hold a charge quite nicely.  The noise canceling feature is wonderful!  Very happy with that.<br /><br />I'm a classical musician, so I'm kind of picky when it comes to speaker sound, and I experimented these earbuds using a variety of my favorite classical hits.  The sound I'm getting is excellent -- a bit surprising as I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it is.<br /><br />No problems so far -- highly recommended!",positive,positive
B07RD8B8ZB,5.0,"This adjustable tablet holder is fairly straightforward. With the clamps manually extended, then slid into position, the holding is reasonably easy to use. When clamped into place, it does seem to hold the tablet firmly. I was attempting to use it with my kindle (including its cover) and the extra thickness of the cover didnt seem to be a problem.<br /><br />This has a 5/8 inch mount that will screw directly onto a mic stand, which is how I intend to use it. It also comes with a clamp to allow clamping it onto the shaft (allowing a mic to still be mounted at the top). So I wanted to try that... it turns out, even using that clamping system, the whole thing was held firmly in place! Impressive!<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this tablet mount... my plan is to use it in front of my elliptical machine for workouts.",positive,positive

B00HQCIDGI,5.0,"My desk gets crowded with the bulky 10-port USB hub I had been using so when this review sample arrived I was immediately pleased with the size. It is the perfect complement to my ThinkPad T61 which comes with three USB ports to begin with.<br /><br />I will not repeat the exceptionally helpful review that Daisy S posted on February 11, 2014 - she thoroughly tested the specs and gave some pointers for also using this via the OTG interface on tablets. This also works on any OTG-capable phone using her approach because I tested it on my Galaxy Note 3.<br /><br />A big plus is this not only works with USB 3.0 interfaces, but is backward compatible to earlier versions of the USB spec, including 1.0. That means that I can use this on my legacy devices around the house, as well as my newer 'toys'.<br /><br />The final thing that I like about this hub is the construction. The manufacturer did not cut corners on cable gauge and the small details like strain relief, precision made connectors and other areas that cheaper brands do. The quality is there and this does work as advertised.",positive,positive
B09BZ1HH81,5.0,"Navigating on a pc screen requires a mouse of some sort. They have come a long way over the years, with more features and more comfort. One that is great for those who like to add a little color to their navigation is this wireless mouse from PEIOUS.<br /><br />Shaped for your hands, this mouse is comfortable to hold and click. It’s easy enough to use and you can’t feel any strain on your hands, so it earns good marks there. But the feature that is most appealing is the lights. You can change the lights to different modes and even shut them off completely, if you prefer. I like that the lights are soft- you notice them, but they are not so bright that they distract from what you are doing.<br /><br />The bluetooth works okay on this mouse and one of the more unusual features is that you have to plug it in to charge. With most others I have used, you need to supply batteries, but this one charges by plugging it into a usb outlet. It’s nice not to have to buy batteries, but it also means you need to have a usb nearby for charging purposes. I consider this feature a plus, as I hate having to search for batteries when the need arises.<br /><br />To conserve power with this mouse, there is a switch to shut it off. Plus, it will automatically shut off, to preserve power, if there is no movement for several minutes. This is good because, with regular use, you will need to recharge this more than you realize and saving power makes a difference.<br /><br />Computers need a means for navigation and that requires a mouse of one type or another. You could go for the boring, ordinary mouse with buttons to click and nothing more, or you could have a little fun and get this wireless mouse from PEIOUS. I vote for the latter. It might only be a mouse, but the lights and the elimination of batteries make this a standout mouse and one I recommend.",positive,positive
B00KF9LHUI,5.0,"Long story short, my review sample was immediately recognized by my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone when I plugged the dongle into one of the ports on my [[ASIN:B00KMKKJWW Unitek USB 3.0 hub 4 port Bus-Powered OTG hub]]. It was also immediately recognized and functional on my ThinkPad T61 running XP.<br /><br />As great as it is, you need to pay attention to details when unpacking it. Specifically, the cardboard insert in the retail packaging has a web site for the manual. That is important because this thing will make no sense to you without it, unless you have used one of these before. The manual you will want to download is for model KP-810-10.<br /><br />Basically, the dongle is cleverly stored in the body of the keyboard, and the key is to find the small power switch, which is on the upper left side. After that you are literally up and running. While this makes a wonderful remote for a PC doing presentations, it's even handier connected to any android phone or device that recognizes an OTG connection. That is where this thing excels.  However, for Windows PCs this is also optimum because it has Windows keys.<br /><br />If you need a remote for a Windows PC, or want a convenient way to interact with your OTG-capable phone or tablet this may well become your best friend. I can actually get real work done using this and my Note 3 phone. That is why I gave it five solid stars.",positive,positive
B00006JPRN,4.0,"I work in a middle school special needs classroom. We have 2 autistic boys in the room who spend their daily computer time watching movie clips from various children's movies and TV shows. They usually watch the same clip over and over and over. It gets really annoying and loud with 2 different soundtracks going on simultaneously. They were using ear buds when watching their clips, but those broke before the holidays. After a week of no headphones, I decided to order these for them. I actually ordered 3 pairs, one for each of our classroom computers. These aren't super high quality headphones, but they are working great for our students. Yes, it would be wonderful if we had some of those nice, padded, over the ear earphones, but we don't.

B00U2TJ6HW,5.0,"I received this as a review sample and have been using it for a little less than a week. At the time of this review this tablet is shipping with Android 4.4.4. Before I dive into what I like and why I rated it so highly I want to set expectations.<br /><br />This DOES NOT come with bluetooth, and the screen and cameras are not especially spectacular. The screen is readable (easily so) and has nice, vivid colors. However compared to even my Note 3 phone it falls short. As the cameras, for some reason tablet makers seem to skimp on those as though they are an afterthought.<br /><br />Since there is no bluetooth you are stuck with the internal speaker or using phones. The internal speaker is not what I would call optimum for listening to music, but the included phones are surprisingly decent. I also connected one of my bluetooth speakers that accepts 3.5mm input and the sound was excellent, so while this does not have bluetooth, you can still stream music to it.<br /><br />Another thing it does not have is bloatware that every other tablet (and phone) seems to  be plagued with. That is one of the reasons why I rated this so highly. But the real reason why I gave this tablet five stars is price. At the time of this review it is selling for sixty bucks, which is not a bad deal for an entry level tablet - especially if you want to browse the web, stream music or wile away the day on facebook.<br /><br />It is a complete package that includes a stylus, soft bag, charger and cable, and OTG adapter. The latter allows you to connect USB peripherals to the micro USB charging port. I tested it with a keyboard, then a mouse and it recognized both. The USB charging port is another thing I like - it;s a micro USB type, which is a major improvement over some entry level tablets that I have tested that use a non-standard barrel connector.<br /><br />You can add a 32GB SD card using a TF adapter. I tested it with an old SanDisk Ultra 32GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS Memory Card that was immediately recognized. The application manager allows you to move some apps to the SD card, so as you add your favorites some will be eligible for running off an external card (depending on the app, of course.) Browsing the web, using Google's location feature and maps, and Youtube all performed with no lag or issues. In fact I would put the performance head-to-head against my Verizon Ellipsis 7 4G LTE Tablet, Black 7-Inch 8GB tablet. Do note, though, that if you have all services turned on and are constantly using this tablet you are going to get about 2.5 to 3 hours of use time if you are not connected to a charger. For some folks that may be a deal breaker, so take that into account.<br /><br />Basically this is a stripped down, but very functional tablet for folks on a budget. If you can live without bluetooth and will be using it near a power source it's a decent tool (or toy, depending on your outlook) at an affordable price, It is a perfect first tablet for someone who also has an Android phone, and is definitely useful for folks addicted to the web.",positive,negative
B07Q1BF8KJ,5.0,"I bought it for use with my tv. We have a smart tc with terrible speakers. Well, more like the sound is terrible with some apps, like Netflix or Amazon Prime- where the volume is sometimes not able to go up enough to really hear it, and I have sound sensitive ears. So I bought this thinking that it could lend a boost to the sound. I was able to get it to work with the cable, and the DVD player (the two areas that really don't need help), but could not get it to function with the tv itself. I tried all options, and I am either missing something or it just doesn't work with the tv. So while that issue *may* be on my end alone, I will just rate it on the actual sound.<br /><br />The sound it produces is definitely a boost over what I am used to with the tv speakers. It doesn't have a dynamic sound, but it isn't flat either. Not directional, more in the front sound. Clean though.  I think it would be better for use with a phone, tablet, or even lap top- where you just need some clean volume. It is long, but it is sleek. It can be controlled from the unit, or with the remote. The remote is uncomplicated and makes sense it its layout.<br /><br />So while it ultimately isn't working (right now) for MY purpose (I aim to figure it out), it is a nice speaker, at a decent price point (I wouldn't got higher), and the options it provides is nice. Normally I go into mega detail on items like this, but there are already plenty of reviews that go over the specs nicely. So in short,<br /><br />-Long charge<br />-Easy blue tooth connectivity<br />-Comes with connectors<br />-comes with remote for volume, power, and switching between outputs<br />-easy to follow short instruction pamphlet<br />-TF card option<br />-USB<br />-AC adapter<br />-built in microphone (which I haven't used, and have no intention of using)<br />--slim, sleek design<br />--has great volume capacity, not super dynamic- but different ears will pick up different sounds. I am attuned to nuances, so I can tell that this speaker doesn't go there.. BUT I still recommend it, overall.<br /><br />I figure out anything else, or if I get it working for my needs, I will be back to update. I hope my little bit helped, even if it was just reinforcing the more detailed reviews. Take care, and enjoy your day :)<br /><br />EDIT!!!  Perfection!! OK, so I took one more try at trying to get the sound to work with Netflix & Prime. I was watching Captain America last night, and could barely hear it despite the volume turned way up. I realized that the last time I had tried to use this speaker for that, I may have had the tv volume down and of course it wouldn't pick up on sound. For cable, you want volume on tv down as it is running through cable box and you the sound to only come through this speaker. For roku, etc, you would just plug it into the headphone slot, and hence want the volume up. The addition of the speaker totally amplifies the sound AND it did a great job with the sound nuances of the movie. It didn't just add volume, it enhanced the overall sound. SO this really impressed me and I knew I had to come back to update my review. I already liked the speaker at 4 stars, but now I am really happy to have this in my life. It makes ALL the difference in our program watching as we typically use Netflix and Prime daily and it is frustrating that the volume is greatly reduced. Now it is better than ever. The sound is large and fills the room, and I can hear various other tones and bass within the movie- so I guess it depends on the source not just the speaker..",positive,positive
B01DM6BDA4,1.0,"PLEASE PLEASE, do not buy these cameras and the doorbell. I did not listen. Now I am not going to use a lot of big words to describe the problem. I am just going to tell you the truth. I am 70 years old and I purchased these cameras because I live alone and I wanted security. I am not secure and I do not feel secure. I purchased due to all the advertisements and because Shaq endorsed them. They do not work and the customer service really sucks. One day I was put on hold for 45 minutes then hung up on. The supervisors are no help at all. I purchased 3 floodlight cameras and 1 doorbell camera. They all are malfunctioning. The doorbell does not alert until the person is long gone. What is the purpose if the incident is over before you can even see it. Then you cannot even pull the incident up for about 4-5 minutes! You have to wait to see who was at your door and that's not safe. in 4-5 minutes someone could already be in your house!! I have horrible neighbors who are interfering with one of the floodlight cameras and literally making it go off every 1-3 minutes. I've called ring over 52 times since October of 2019. They cannot or will not resolve the issue, other than tell me the camera cannot be tampered with. I KNOW THAT IS NOT CORRECT! If you buy these cameras buy at your own risk. I am here to tell you that they do not work and customer service will not help you when they fail and they will fail!!!! Shame on you Shaq O' Neal. Shame on you Amazon for buying and selling this mess !!!!!!!  On my last recent call to Ring I was told that the cameras do not work in real time. The representatives say whatever they want to try and get you to hang up. I'm 70 not senile. Someone named Richmond told me that! The commercials show the people walking up, you activating the sound and talking to the person. One of My problems is the people are already gone before the camera actually activates. I would look into buying something else if I could afford it. You have a choice. DO NOT BUY RING. Do not be tricked like I was.",negative,negative
B005M0LWXW,4.0,"Compared to the Duracell Inverter we have, the quality of the battery hookups is a bit cheaper and thinner.  However, this little inverter is adequate for the job of recharging ipods and cell phones.  Although this unit says you have up to 175 watts, that is peak power.  Consistent wattage is 130 so you want to be sure that what you have to use on this needs to be consistent with the 130 wattage instead.  I would not go above that, as 175 is PEAK.<br /><br />The unit is easy to use, you can plug it into the cigarette lighter in the car and it provides power to the USB port for easy recharging.  There is a little fan on it and a light to indicates that it is working.  I also tested out the battery usage, and it is great to use for campsites, or other areas where you might need to have a way to run simple 130 watt (or near it) electrical units or recharging of cell phones, etc.<br /><br />The packaging was great- quick open and easy to get to.  No struggling with plastic packages that are frustrating, etc.<br /><br />This is a great simple inverter to have on hand for recharging of various USB friendly components.

B00HVLURL8,3.0,"Comparing any headphone to Sony Studio, the sound quality-- stage, stereo separation, loudness, instrument separation, instrument tone, bass response, surround channel -- fails to measure up, or even come close.

B000IE8Z4Q,3.0,"The sound is fine.  It's what I would expect from quality tweeters and a reasonable size woofer with a decent driver.  It does not compare to a decent set of bookshelf type monitors like the JBL LSR series but the price is far lower so I guess they're ok for PC speakers.<br /><br />But the excellence ends at the sound.  The speakers do not have an analog signal input from the computer (there is one at the puck for a MP3 player or whatever).  Instead, the signal comes via USB.  The problem is the speakers do not come with any drivers.  Bose assumes you have the drivers already on your Windows installation.  That's a very bad assumption as many people do not have the drivers (just do a google search on Bose Companion 5 drivers to see).  There's no help from Bose here.  The drivers cannot be downloaded from their web site.  I called Bose's tech support and after half and hour they were not able to solve the problem.  I eventually solved the problem myself on my Windows 7 Pro 64-bit install but I think it's terribly lame that Bose cannot provide the driver for their product.  If I wasn't using the pre-load install of Windows they assume everyone uses, then I would be screwed.<br /><br />So exactly what do I get for this odd USB input in lieu of a standard audio input?  Nothing except incompatibility and the inability to use the speakers apart from a full blown PC.  The audio quality and features are not improved by USB audio input.  Period.<br /><br />Room mode correction should be a straightforward feaure on speakers like these.  It is not.  Although my sound card supports it, the Bose speakers do not have the DSP to do it independently.  The lack of sound-card independent RMC doesn't justify the high cost of these speakers.  If it were included, the price would look a little better.<br /><br />I installed the Companion 5 system on an Ergotron cart.  The two speakers fit perfectly under the monitor the way I wanted (I removed the stands).  The acoustimass is bulkier than I would have liked but I think it's fair to say a smaller module would not perform as well and for most under-desk installs it would be fine.  What I do think it's fair to complain about is the poor design of the acoustimass module case.  Despite being very heavy, it features a plastic rear end-cap that is fragile.  Come-on.  For the price, give me painted steel not brittle plastic.  The case is also oddly shaped with curves that prevent anything but a bottom-down mount position.  The case is not designed to be mounted in a down-firing position, up-firing or on it's side or upside down.  The case is also not equipped or rated to be flown or ceiling mounted (it could fall apart and drop parts on people below).  Bose should know these are all viable positions.  Not everyone can have this thing on the floor with like six wires running out for people to trip over -- seriously, that is totally not acceptable in a public space.<br /><br />Bose has a habit of not publishing Watts RMS specifications for their amplifiers or speaker handling abilities.  I sort of understand not wanting to confuse consumers who don't understand driver efficiencies, but at least give us some max. 1 meter SPL's so we have some clue how loud these things are.  As it is, the Companion 5 is loud enough for a PC system in a fairly live medium-sized residential room.  It's much louder than my Wave system which proved way more anemic than it was made out to be.  The Wave is useless except in the smallest bedroom.  I use the Companion 5 primarily in my kitchen (on the Ergotron cart).  The kitchen is fairly live but has some acoustic paneling to tame some of the reverberations.  If I were putting this system in a small classroom, I would think twice.  As a PC system for someone who sits right in front of it, it's obviously perfectly good.  I probably wouldn't even use it at half-volume sitting that close.",positive,negative

B005DKZP7A,5.0,"I've heard about these foam tips for quite some time, but staved off as the gel ones that came with my [[ASIN:B000FUESSU V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds (Bling Bling Black)]] worked just fine.  The bass is great, and the gel bud tips enhance the sound even further.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I decided to order these just to see what the fuss was about.  Many other reviewers seem to give them great reviews, so I, what with me being a bass freak, decided to give them a whirl.<br />At first they're excellent, and fit extremely comfortable.  After a few wears, though, they seem to lose their greatness and tightness.  HOWEVER, and this is a big however, they once again expand to perfectly fit the inside of my ear.  Not sure how that happened, but they went back to how they first fit, but even more comfortably.<br /><br />If that's not the case for everyone, and the foam tips just collapse with time, then I'd say avoid these.  BUT because with my experience they retained their fit inside my ear, and were indeed customized over time to fit perfectly, then I tout these to the extreme.  Just go to the product page and make sure they fit your earbud headphones.  They're a bit pricey, yes, so not necessary if what you have works fine; they just provide more comfort and enhance the bass for me.",positive,positive

B005404P9I,5.0,"Just a phenomenal cpu.  This is probably the best upgrade Ive done, coming from an i7 7700k. I had 30 days to use and figure out if I wanted to stay with this or go with the latest AMD cpu.<br /><br />Work- I used to have trouble running programs that were either too complex or inefficiently coded that it led to stutters, hitches, delays or freezes.  One program that always caused massive trouble for me over the years was the Think or Swim trading platform.  I originally upgraded to the i7 7700k and it could not handle more than 2-3 chart at a time running the time and sales and L2.  Run some side charts and you could forget about trading, especially at the open when calculations need to be run at an extremely rapid pace.  I even added a total of 32gb ddr4 3400 ram and it still wouldnt run properly.  Arguably, the program is encoded really inefficiently requiring much more from the CPU than necessary.  Ive tried many different trading programs and this one caused the most trouble.  After stepping up to the i9 9900k I can now run this inefficiently encoded program on my main chart screen, with two different tickers having 4 different time frames each with its own L2 and time and sales, PLUS 15 side charts without a hitch! Also im running my browser with at least 5 tabs open and video/audio running.  Absolutely amazing.  I never thought I could get it to work like this.<br /><br />Gaming- even if the cpu doesnt run at 100 pct it affects the quality of the experience of the gameplay, especially for demanding games, or just poorly coded, inefficient ones.  RPGs fall into these categories. I.e., Kingdom Come Deliverance.  Video and streaming is flawless as well.<br /><br />Vs AMD- Performance isnt always about raw numbers, if there are too many peaks and valleys, it affects the quality of the experience.  I havent personally compared it directly to the newest AMD cpu, but having looked at the side by side comparisons, AMD cpu seems to put out better numbers for work-related applications, but clearly on the gaming side, intel is superior.  From my observation, the quality of the experience with Intel was greater because the frame rate was consistent with much less, if any micro stuttering, which you can see with the AMD chips.  As a result, Intel's presentation was more effortless and smooth.  With the AMD setup, you can see some graying/discoloring/hazy effects in demanding scenes.  It seems like AMD is an overcharged chip that experiences these dips because of that, causing a deterioration in the experience. AMD is perfectly fine for work I presume, but not for me when it comes to gaming. Intel performs like a more refined, polished product.  This is just based on my personal observation of their performance in these two different areas.<br /><br />Overclocking- its perfectly fine using it the way it is.  No need to overclock, but of course you can overclock it.  I run mine 16 hours a day without any problems. Top recommendation at the asking price these days.",positive,positive
B07SK522H4,4.0,"I have tested many earbuds that range in price from $10 to over $100, and I must say these sound very decent in this price range and better than some that cost twice as much. They are very bass-midrange centric, but the sound clarity is superb, and they have not distorted at the loudest volume I could stand. I heard instrumental detail I would not have expected in a pair of $25 earbuds. I thought the heavier bass and midrange would seem unbalanced and bothersome, but it wasn't after listening to a range of music for a few hours. I haven't tried them on phone calls yet, but if the music sounds this clean and clear, I am sure my phone calls will as well. I will update my review if it doesn't live up to my expectations.

B073HLQBNH,4.0,"I have the grey TrackR Pixel and I am using it on our spare garage door opener. It's the opener we give to houseguests to use while they are here and on more than one occasion, it's gotten misplaced. Hopefully, this TrackR will cut down on aggravation of hunting down the opener n the future.<br /><br />Once you load the TrackR app on your phone, it gives you pairing instructions via Bluetooth and you're ready to go. You have to allow the location permission in the app for this to work. There's a large button to press for location of the TrackR and you can make some small customization of the alert sound.<br /><br />Actual use is a bit limited. My TrackR can't be found or alerted once I get more than roughly, twenty feet away from it. If you know your misplaced item is in a specific area this might not be a problem.

B074X9SC1C,3.0,"I give it 5 stars with 2 caveats. First, it's not stated in the description that it recognizes fewer formats when in BT mode and the instructions seem to be lacking in detail, so it took a while to figure out how to access all of the functions. Hint: You can only access playback functions while in BT because BT, itself, is a sub-folder, so you have to back out of BT to do other things.<br /><br />Ultimately, I gave it 5 stars because a) i had just a few songs in the missing formats and b) once I got past the navigation issues, it works quite well and the company was very helpful when I needed them.<br /><br />Update: Turns out as I loaded more music I found a lot more music that wasn't found while in BT, including some albums where some of the songs appeared and some didn't. Al in all, it's kind of clumsy to navigate in BT and BT was the feature I wanted most.<br /><br />However, it sounds good with the earbuds that they provide and it's size makes it convenient. The 8gb are plenty if you don't have a lot of music. I do, so I added a 32gb sd mini-card which is as large as it will take.",positive,negative

B00EX9JA78,5.0,"For five dollars, this was almost too good to be true. I love this case. It fits my new 7&#34; Fire HDX perfectly - the tablet just pops into the four corner slots and stays put. The cutouts for the speakers, power & volume buttons and the charging slot are all easily accessed and functional. When the case is open & folded back, the hand strap is tight and sturdy, allowing you to securely hold the Fire while reading or playing a game - sort of reminds me of the feel of an old school paperback with the front cover folded back. The case adds no weight or real girth to the Fire, still fits into my handbag and the center console of the car easily. This case does put the Fire to sleep and wakes it up when completely closed, which is nice for battery savings if you use your Fire like I do - it's feeding music and audio books to my car's stereo system via the Bluetooth streaming, but there's no reason for the screen to be running or the XRay lyrics info etc while I'm driving. I can set the Fire to stream my audio content, shut the case and go on with my business.

B01DLXB8JO,5.0,"These earbuds are the best ever! I've tried a few brands, lots of Apple, and none compete with these earbuds. Most of all because they are so ergonomic / comfortable. The wires go over the top of your ears and the wire molds to your ear however you adjust it. So the earbuds never fall out and all the weight is taken off your ear canal area. They are also low profile and I can even comfortably lay with my head/ear on a pillow. The microphone works great for phone calls. And the buttons are marked and with 3 individual buttons so it's easy to know which one you're pushing without looking. I also love the shirt clip, minor as that may seem. Makes using the buttons much easier. I've only had these earbuds about a week. They seem sturdy. I'll update my review if they stop working. This will be my go-to earbud from now on!!

B083YYM8CK,4.0,"I've had two phone calls with this so far, and I love the fact that I don't have to put the dirty phone up to my ear to take a call. The downside though is that even if I'm not walking around, the call seems to break up a bit. Not sure if this happens when the cord naturally moves around, but it shouldn't have such a loose connection to cause the call to break up. It could have been the other party I was talking to, but I talk to him often and he made it a point to tell me I was breaking up (and had no idea I was using this), so I don't know. But the sound quality is utterly amazing, just as good as if I hold the phone up to my ear. And I often take dictation, so the receiver makes it a lot easier to type, especially since the phone tends to echo the ""clacking"" of the keys and cut the speaker off so I miss some words they have said, whereas the receiver does not.",positive,positive
B00B1N06PO,2.0,"[Great Sound]<br /><br />As noted in some of the other reviews this pair of headphones has great sound for its price range.  Sound is quite neutral, without the bass emphasis of a lot of headphones at this range.  Highs are also good and not muted.  The cable is also very generous in length, which is great as my computer is far away from my chair.  Finally, the headband adjustment is exceptional.  I have a fairly large skull and most headphones I've purchased have not fit well.  However, this one fits perfectly and even has more room to expand.  The only comfort downside is that the pads have quite a stiff covering material.  This is not so great for comfort for long use sessions, but not too big of an issue as you can replace them eventually if needed.  The thicker pad material would make the headphones last longer...if it were not for the major issue I describe below with build quality.<br /><br />[Disappointing Build Quality]<br /><br />I've had my pair for about 1.5 years now, and today the headphone snapped at the joint between the top band and where the extension band slides out.  See attached photo.  You can see that there is a metal band in the headband to provide elasticity and resistance.  But the extension band (the part that slides in and out) doesn't have a metal band inside of it.  This concentrates stress at this transition point, causing the plastic to snap here eventually.  I noticed that the plastic on the other cup has also started cracking.  The plastic itself feels quite brittle and is about as thick as the metal strip in the headband.  I think the fact that I have a large head and had to extend the headphones out only hastened their demise as this put more stress on the plastic-only part of the headbands.<br /><br />[Conclusion]<br /><br />This is a great sounding pair of headphones for their price, but alas I cannot recommend them anymore due to the snapping of the headband.  To fail after about a year of use is a bit on the low end.  My previous pair of similarly priced headphones lasted over 10 years without the headband failing (only cable had become worn).  I think you *might* be OK if you have a smaller head and don't have to extend the headphone band too much, but if you have to expand it to near its maximum, it will probably snap off like mine did.",negative,negative
B01F710ME0,2.0,"First and foremost, I need a convertible backpack which allows for transport -  all materials needed for the long days on campus (grad student).  In addition, I need the professional aspect to function as a briefcase. Solely on those points, this bag fits the bill.  (BTW - no discount or freebie here for this review - I paid for this!)<br />PROS:<br />1. Material: feels and looks professional, good color, seems at the very least to be water repellent<br />2. Zippers: seem strong enough, especially when loaded - two of them house the briefcase handles<br />3. Padding: quality -  on the backpack straps and particularly the section directly meant for the computer<br />4. Compartments: although the pictures do not necessarily show this, there are zippers on the outside, and inside, a pocket with divisions for pencils/pens/highlighters.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Backpack adjustable straps: are on the lower part not allowing for easy adjustment while on your back<br />2. Lower connection backpack straps: hidden - cannot see whether sewn in well or not<br />3. Strap to hold computer in place: oddly long, which would allow for movement and sliding around, something you don't want your computer to do when inside<br />4. No compartment/pocket for a water bottle (my pet peeve)<br />5. PRIMARY (HUGE) ISSUE: Backpack straps which rest on upper trapezoids (left and right) are situated in a very uncomfortable position when fully loaded.  I'm unsure if it's the angle or the placement, but the straps are too close to your neck and would cause pain.  Primarily for this reason, I'm returning the backpack.  Sad because even with the other cons (more annoyances than anything else) if it were not for this one, I would've kept the backpack because the pros outweigh the cons.<br /><br />Pictures: It's important to see how a backpack will perform in my daily life.  Therefore, the pictures provide a sense of how much stuff this can carry, with the contents both packed and unpacked.<br /><br />Contents: Lenovo ThinkPad T460 in neoprene case, keys, 1 1/2&#34; loose-leaf binder, yearly planner, scientific calculator, computer power cord, small cosmetic case, large cosmetic bag which houses pens/pencils/highlighters/usb drive/mouse/headphones and wallet.<br /><br />Final thoughts: if only used as a briefcase/shoulder bag, this may be for you.  However, if the primary purpose is to function as a backpack, good luck.  I think another reviewer mentioned the oddly-placed backpack straps, but sadly, I ignored that advice.<br />In addition, cannot ascertain the strength of the shoulder strap as I didn't want to break the seal, but it is pictured.",negative,negative

B07V5XS4MV,5.0,"I don't know how it happens but I somehow ended up buying over 20 pairs of bluetooth headphones over the course of my life.  I'm also finding that I can't pass up a good pair of bluetooth headphones.<br /><br />So of the over-head style bluetooth headphones, I've run across problems with short battery life (had one pair that lasts only 3 hours), too tight against the head, presses on the ear (supra-aural) and gets sweaty, active noise cancelling that can't turn on independently of the bluetooth function, and no carrying case.<br /><br />This pair of RCA Active noise cancelling headphones don't have any of those problems.  I sit at my desk all day with an air outlet behind me that is constantly blowing.  I'm able to use them the entire day with music playing without the batteries running down.  I don't keep the noise cancelling on the entire time but when I do, the fan noise is completely blocked out.  Being circumaural headphones, the ear cups completely surround my ears and do not press on them.  In addition, the spring isn't too tight to make me feel like my head is being squeezed in a vice.<br /><br />As far as sound quality, because the speakers are not pressing against the ear, the sound seems to have a wider-room feel, making me feel even more like I don't have headphones on.<br /><br />Overall, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase and don't feel the need to splurge and buy the much more expensive Sony and Bose products.",positive,negative

B00SBBI7VE,5.0,"I received my headband as a review sample. I want to note that I did not experience any drops in streaming as noted by other reviewers when using this with my Samsung Note 3 phone, but did have some issues with my Samsung Tab 3 10.1. The latter has some bluetooth problems that are well known, so I am attributing my issues with Tab 3 flaws and not this headband. I briefly tested this with an HTC One Remix with no problems either.<br /><br />This headband is unique in that it was designed with real, strenuous sports in mind - or at least activities that make you work up a sweat. As such I tested my streaming as noted above with my source devices (phones and tablets) at least twenty feet away. That simulates where you would place those devices during a game of tennis.<br /><br />It does seem impervious to sweat, although I would not call it sweat-proof. If you use it heavily and frequently you'll need to clean it at least weekly - see some of the top rated video reviews on this page for instructions for that because it is a bit tricky disassembling it the first time.<br /><br />Also note that it's a snug fit on my head, which is size 6 7/8. I am guessing that if you wear a men's hat size above 7 1/4 it will be too snug. Take that into account.<br /><br />Sound quality is excellent in my opinion. For the past nine months or so (at the time of this review) all brands or phones seem to have taken a major leap in that respect and these are no exception. The high frequency response of the phones is clear at max volume and the bass is deep (but not thumping). The mid range seems to be the sweet spot, and is rich and full. The volume itself is not super loud, and it is not noise-isolating. It does keep out most ambient noise though, and while these are not perfect for critical listening they are excellent for casual listening during sports and other strenuous activities.<br /><br />If you want phones that stay in place regardless of that you are doing, and also demand respectable sound quality these merit consideration. I have not researched the market, but these are the only headband phones I have come across among the dozens I have tested to date.",positive,positive
B00008AJSQ,4.0,"When buying a product like this, it's wise not to go into the transaction with great expectations.

It also comes with one pair of beige topped discs and a 10ml tube of cream for repairing discs.<br />4. Choose which set of discs you need, press the button to open the lid of the machine, and then insert them in the holes.

Dirty and scratched CDs, DVDs, Game discs and the like can be given a new lease on life.<br />2. Cleaning only takes a minute, and repairing just four minutes.<br />3. Easy to operate<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Looks cheap<br />2. The cleaning and repair solutions are supplied in tiny quantities (30ml and 10ml respectively) which are used up in no time at all.<br />3. Replacement kits of discs and solution are comparatively expensive.<br />4. Noisy<br /><br />However:<br /><br />1. It really worked to repair an extremely scratched PS2 game disc that would no longer play in the system. In just over 4 minutes the game was back in the console and working like new. (Some of the scratches were still visible - apparently the solution forms a coating over scratches)<br />2. It cleaned dirt and fingerprints from an audio disc without any problems.<br /><br />So, in summary:<br /><br />This machine does what it claims to do, but will need replacement cleaning/repairing kits very quickly (sold separately).  It appears fairly sturdy, but I can't see it giving years and years of faithful service.<br /><br />Game discs in particular are very expensive, and having this machine on hand to keep them working can be a worthwhile investment, particularly if they are subject to the usual abuse by generation iY.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 30, 2010",positive,negative

B087NHB75D,4.0,"I've sought a pair of wireless earbuds for a couple years now, both for general use, and for when running/working out. I originally purchased a pair of Blueant Pump earbuds a few years ago. They are completely waterproof, and have over-the-ear hooks designed to keep them firmly attached during vigorous activity. Those buds are very solid overall, but have a couple critical flaws that prompted me to keep searching. My ideal earbuds would have the following characteristics:<br /><br />* truly wireless<br />* strong battery life<br />* in-ear ""wings""/arc support, as opposed to employing over the ear hooks (I sometimes wear glasses and also hats which I didn't want competing for space with the ear buds)<br />* excellent audio (music and phone calls)<br />* hear through/ambient listening capable<br /><br />The Blueant pumps lacked the ambient option, and also had a cable connecting the two buds, which prevented me from effectively performing weight lifting exercises while laying down, since the stiff cable would bump against the bench when I laid back, and knock loose the earbuds, breaking the seal in my ear canal.<br /><br />After exhaustively researching my options, I decided to give the Powerbeats Pro a shot (in spite of the over the ear hooks), as well as these earbuds under review, the Sony WF-SP800N model. I decided against trying out the very popular Jabra Elite Active 75t, due to the shorter battery life relative to the Powerbeats and Sony options.<br /><br />The Powerbeats Pro are indeed comfortable, and do a great job staying in place. What I learned is that they do not offer listen-through audio, (which I need for situational awareness when running/biking), and the audio when taking phone calls was incredibly scratchy. This was not a Bluetooth connectivity issue, because the phone played streaming Spotify audio just fine, and the cell phone was in my pocket the entire time, so distance was a non-factor. I found that I could manage to wear glasses at the same time as the Powerbeats buds, but it was slightly awkward. Additionally, I noticed some worrisome discussion on Reddit about the long term battery life of the Powerbeats Pro model, and so for those factors (and considering the high cost of this item), I decided against the Powerbeats Pro earbuds.<br /><br />The Sony earbuds have performed fantastically. Initially I was disappointed because there was an unbelievable amount of wind noise on my first run using them. The fit felt sloppy and I was concerned about them dropping out of my ear. When I got home, I switched the earbud tips for the largest size. That made all the different in the world. The wind was largely sealed out (there is still some), and the music jumped to life. The fit was true, and I had no problem with the earbuds falling out, even when I went out of my way to shake them loose.<br /><br />Battery life promises to eclipse even the mighty Powerbeats Pro, and the Sony model offers ambient listening. The water resistance looks to be at least the equal of the Powerbeats, and phone call clarity was excellent. All this at a price more than $100 less than the Powerbeats.<br /><br />I will update this review if my opinion changes significantly as I get more time in with these Sony earbuds. Based on my initial experiences, I strongly recommend them, for both athletic and casual use. They are excellent.",positive,negative

I was even more impressed with the build quality. There was little to no keyboard flex at all, and the casing is actually made of what looks like a brushed aluminum. Keystroke is surprisingly long for how thin the keyboard is, but has good feel. I only would not recommend this for gaming because of its size. However, it's size does bring it extreme portability. I love the backlight as well, it really does help with dark situations. My only complaint, is that the backlight only has two colors, instead of being a true RGB light.",positive,positive

This is the endgame of iPad keyboard cases right next to Apple's flagship magic keyboard. I love the some what fabric/felt texture of the case and the main take away is the detachable and reversible keyboard so you never have to hold on to keys when you're in tablet mode. Or just remove it all together and rock it super slim. The only gripe is the pencil doesn't have a flap or sleeve to prevent it from being knocked off easily, especially if you have some sort of pencil sleeve like me. Other than that, I'm happy with this purchase and I'd recommend it for anyone willing to spend the money on this keyboard case.",positive,positive
B09LK7TRYV,4.0,"Likes.<br />Good build quality.<br />The sound quality of the music is fine.<br />Quickly connected to my Iphones and Ipads.<br />Comfortable enough.<br /><br />Dislikes.<br />No plug provided.<br /><br />I am an audiophile of sorts.  I have a Bang and Olufsen soundbar, a Sonos Playbar, and a Sonos Beam.  Obviously, these headphones do not compare.  The music quality is very acceptable for my purpose.<br /><br />My wife has the main TV on 12 hours a day at a mid volume.  I like to sit in the same room because the comfortable chairs are in that room.  The TV dialogue was very annoying to me.  These headphones do a great job of allowing me to enjoy my music, as they block out the TV sound very well.<br /><br />The quiet mode works well.  It is not a true noise cancellation headphone.  That’s okay.  There is no annoying air pressure, just 3 modes of what is best described as programmed white noise, such as rainfall.  Excellent for blocking sound.<br /><br />The phone quality is excellent.  You do have to hit a button on the earphones, if a call come in, or to call out.  The “active,”  feature shown in the instructions controls a lot of the features.<br /><br />Although it was a snap pairing it with my iPhones and IPads I wasn’t able to pair it with my Samsung or LG OLED TV. I also wasn’t able to pair it with my Apple TV.  I’ll keep trying.<br /><br />I was considering buying the Airpod Max for my over the ear headphone.  It’s been available for about $ 450.  I figured I would upgrade every year. However, I checked the big yellow store and the trade in value was only $ 80, for the current model.  WOW. Pay $ 450 today, get $ 80 tomorrow.  No thanks.<br /><br />My dislike was that a plug was not provided. It seems minor.  However, I received a $ 90 pole lamp from Amazon and the plug was missing.  I used a plug from another pole lamp and it blew out my new lamp.  The wattage was too high.  Who knew?  The instructions say to use a 5W plug.  Reading the microscopic lettering on the plugs has you guessing what the wattage is.  I used a basic Amazon tablet plug and it worked.<br /><br />Overall.  The build quality is excellent and I believe it’s a very good value overall.",positive,negative
B08MX84FT4,5.0,"I purchased these because I have a BT transmitter permanently installed in the center console of my car and I needed to get power to it in as unobtrusive a way as possible. I really like how this comes with both a left-handed and right-handed extension cable, since I could experiment with what worked best for my setup. The cable itself seems sturdy; I cannot comment on its fast charging ability, as the BT transmitter has minimum power requirements, but it does provide it with what it needs. The short length is ideal for my use case - just enough, no extra. As for durability, I had to make a sharp right-hand turn with the cable at the USB-A side and I think the strain relief is more than ample to handle it.<br /><br />Would recommend.",positive,negative

I am partial to mechanical keyboards so it is hard to transition to a normal keyboard and still type with precision, but the keys on this keyboard have great rebound and I have had no trouble typing with it. The keys are also surprisingly quiet, which makes it useful in any setting. Even the box that it came in is great for storage. I also like that their are a number of hot key/function keys. Even better there is a function lock button that allows you to use the function keys continuously without needing to press the function key. The mouse clicks are also extremely quiet, and I had no issues with the plug and play as soon as I put the usb receiver in it everything was ready to go. Even though this is a full size keyboard with a full number pad, the thin structure makes it useful as a travel keyboard as well. I recently used it on a trip with my iPad and it came in very handy. I like the mouse but I think the keyboard is definitely the star of this combo, and highly recommend as it is a great value for the price.",positive,positive

But this little speaker wins it hands down for being so compact.  I am looking forward to throwing this speaker into my bag and listening to it at work.  I also loved this speaker as it allows me to use my shuffle, nano or classic (which the ihome only allows for the bottom insert to be used) whereas the x-mini uses the earphone port (more universal for the different ipod models).<br /><br />I also like this speaker as it uses the universal USB port to charge the chargeable battery in the speakers.

B0079MVKII,4.0,"I have an LG TV 47"" so I thought another LG product might be the best course of action (of course the money involved had to do with this decision), so I went to my local Best Buy to get a glimpse of what is out there. Besides this LG sound bar they had quite a few choices. I quick referenced them to their reviews and came to the conclusion that most sound bars are just about at the same level in terms of overall performance. I did see a Bowers and Wilkins?, priced around $2200, which is way more expensive than the tv itself (but was taught that audio is supposed to be the greater investment for the true tv viewer), and this sound bar frankly was fantastic, truly a thing to behold.  But $2200 Buckaroos are a long way from $300 and I did get the tv at a great bargain price, so cheap instead of expensive became the call of war.<br />For what I got this soundbar does everything I wanted done. It was very easy to install through the optical option, and even though the first unit I purchased had troubles pairing with the subwoofer and was returned immediately, the second was the charm and now it works very nicely with the added plus that it certainly did not require a Kamikaze investment.  Works very well and it adds a great sound capability to the living room in our home which was the intended site.  Some shows are better than others but even the subwoofer does its magic and is a lot of fun to crank it up once in a while, specially for the internet type movie sites (like Netflix, Amazon, Vudu, etc.) that come with the smart tv and required some sort of subscription. Their sound, specially amazon and netflix, was way below average and even at maximum volume on the tv it was very sad. I could hear it but one of the members of the tribe is a little more than a little hard of hearing and was always having trouble (probably the main reason why I decided on a sound bar in the first place).<br />Needless to say this soundbar delivered what was expected of the product and now my living room is one loud area and when the subwoofer is doing its thing you can feel it kind of in the furniture itself, like some of the controllers in PS3 with the added vibration. Minor thing but rather invigorating, for the whole room now sounds like a mini theater without having had to add several speakers coupled with tedious connections, which certainly I am not qualified or inclined to want to do myself. I just put the sound bar in the same table in which the television rest and the subwoofer about 6 feet away and voila! Just waiting for the neighbors to reassure me as to the loudness, kind of like its baptism when they finally complain (makes you feel a little bit proud that you are putting enough noise to draw the attention of nearby houses, silly but what can you do sometimes?), so for now I am very happy with the purchase and glad that when necessary I have the equipment to raise the noise way higher than it was capable before. 4 very solid Stars!",positive,positive

B00NGK92IM,5.0,"This little ACER ASPIRE SWITCH 10 LAPTOP has a display to die for.  To my eye, it's as clear and sharp as the iPad Mini Retinal display.  And the display is quick!  Pages load fast, and the touchscreen is very responsive.<br /><br />In designing this little ""convertible"" laptop, Acer got the concept exactly right.  The display and keyboard together constitute a small notebook computer that is just large enough for doing real writing work.  (As long as you don't type too fast--there is a slight delay in communications between the keyboard and display.)  The built-in, buttonless mouse works smoothly, and I like the feature where you push the lower left or lower right corner of the mousepad to left-click or right-click.  (You do have to watch that you don't move the mouse pointer off target when you click.)  This laptop even comes with a one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365 (software is installed, the activation code is in the box).<br /><br />But the ""convertible"" laptop is also a standalone tablet with a sensitive, fast touchscreen.  The display lifts off easily from two tabs at the back of the keyboard, so that you can check email, shop online, or search the Internet without holding up any extra keyboard weight.  When you're done using the tablet, the display clicks back onto the tabs, and the laptop closes up like any standard laptop (so you don't need a tablet cover, or even a screen protector for the touchscreen).  The settings that allow you to shut down or put the laptop to sleep when you close the cover work as usual. The display can also be detached and reattached facing backwards, so that the keyboard becomes a display stand.<br /><br />This little Windows 8.1 laptop can do a lot of things.  The display/tablet has a webcam, stereo speakers, a microphone for sound recording, a microSD card slot, a microUSB connector for connecting to USB devices, an HDMI micro connector that supports hi-def digital video connections, a headset/speaker jack,  and a DC-in jack for charging.<br /><br />The keyboard has a single USB port.  I used the USB port to connect an external CD/DVD drive and play music from a CDROM.  The USB port is also useful for file transfers via flash drive, or for backing up files to an external storage drive.  Because this little notebook has only 64GB storage capacity (other tablets have 16GB to 64GB storage capacity), you will almost certainly need to back up music, pictures, and other files to an external drive or to cloud storage eventually.  But you can also copy files off the tablet without using wireless or connecting the tablet via USB cable to another PC, because the tablet/keyboard combo is a full-fledged Win8.1 computer.<br /><br />I like this ACER ASPIRE SWITCH 10 a lot, because it is so compact, portable, extremely lightweight, and versatile. And  I even like the Windows 8.1 operating system, which makes a lot of sense for a small tablet computer like this one.",positive,positive

I have a bluetooth mouse and keyboard and I could not get either to pair.  Other than that, still worth the $30 but I would be disappointed if I paid more.",positive,negative

B00KONCDVM,5.0,"Pros:<br />1. Wireless BT works great. 35 plus feet. I've tested using in another room from my phone about 30 feet with the door closed. Did not drop the signal.<br />2. Noise isolation is very good. Can't hear my kids yelling and the dog barking.<br />3. Quality of sound is very good. Bass is good.<br />5. Charge lasts at least 4 hours from my testing. They will last longer but I have not tested beyond that. They recharge in about an hour or so. Standard USB connector for charging is good. So I can use other cables if need be.<br />4. Fit works very well after getting used to putting them on. They do not fall off during jogging or other high motion exercises.<br />6. BT connects automatically after first setup. My other BT headphones do not and it's an extra painful step that these allow me to skip.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Fit gets to be uncomfortable after longer uses. This is acceptable, as these need to be secure in your ear so they don't fall out while moving around or exercising. I would not recommend if you will be using for longer periods of time, as comfort will probably be an issue. Not as much a Con on the product but the type of headphone.<br />2. Profile could be a bit smaller. They sick out a bit far but not any more than other BT headphones I've seen. I would have liked to wear these under my motorcycle helmet but they stick out too far.",positive,negative
B082H3L68P,2.0,"pretty simple install, really nothing to do but plug it in. For this I used an LG HBS-780 Bluetooth headset which is like a horseshoe hanging around your neck with earbuds. Headset connected no problem and sounds great, however the range is pretty bad. If I hold my hand a few inches from my neck in between the headset and the Bluetooth dongle the sound starts to cut out - and i'm literally 2 ft from the computer tower at chest level seated and the dongle is plugged into the front of the tower. I got up and walked out of the room for a total of about 8 ft and lost sound pretty much. Also the package it came in was ripped open - so I know it was a return from someone else.",negative,negative

Works well as long as the batteries are good!<br />The first ones I tried were used from another gadget in my house, and although the little red LED would light up to tell me that it received the signal from the transmitter, the flash didn't fire. Fresh batteries fixed it, however. I guess it needed more voltage to fire the speedlight than my semi-used batteries had. So lesson here is: Keep fresh batteries in it, and you'll be great!<br /><br />Used it on my Sony A7s and A7Rii.",positive,positive

B00KT7GRUQ,5.0,I have purchased 6 different kinds of headsets trying to find that correct fit for when I exercise. I run 8 - 10 miles at a time so earbuds fall out when I sweat.  I threw out my Sony (ear wrap) headphones before my last run out of frustration. They won't stay in so it sounds like a walkie talkie at best.  Yesterday I stopped at Walgreen's and picked up the IHIP head phones.  FINALLY!!!  A headphone that stays.  They are a solid fit and for $16 the sound is just fine.  Surprised to see the other ratings so low.  If you want something that will stay in at an affordable cost then this is a 5 star product. I also saw a complaint about bass.  I was listening to BassNectar on my run and honestly it sounded just fine. I'm a fan for the price.,positive,positive
B08BTP5N5H,4.0,"With the right tips, these sound fantastic. I can imagine with further ""break-in"" and maybe some customization, they will be phenomenal. They are a little bass-heavy, but nothing too detrimental.<br /><br />For reference, here's what I used:<br />- Samsung Note8<br />- VE Odyssey HD DAC<br />- Poweramp v3<br />- songs ripped from CD into FLAC using EAC<br /><br />Here's my previous experience:<br />- 1More Quad<br />- Audio Technica ATH-M50x<br />- Sony WH-1000MX3<br />- Technics EAH-AZ70W<br /><br />These sound better than the Technics, but not nearly as good as the Sony. With that said, these wired headphones aren't exactly the best spokesperson for staying wired. I'm all for wired for both audio and video, but I admit that wireless options like the Sony and Technics make me a believer. With the right codecs and setup, you can achieve wonderful results.<br /><br />There is supreme comfort with these IEMs. With the right tips, I got them fitting snugly in my ear (but there is some trial with error), and there is a metal right around the ear to allow the wire to stay in place. But I question whether these IEMs are worth the price. For $300 you can get cheaper IEMs (imported) with better tips and cables and still have some change in your wallet. And with the push into wireless around the same price range, Shure really needs to push their technology and rely less on their name. Their name alone certainly commands attention, but the wallet is stronger.",positive,positive

B0001WV6ZU,5.0,"I picked up this little beauty to replace both an ancient and cranky 5-disc CD Player and a single disc DVD player.  I now have breathing room in the old entertainment center, so even my antique turntable can take a creaky spin every now and again.<br /><br />Seeing that I can't connect a toaster without help, I called on my trusty better half to unravel the mystery of setting it up. In non-technical language, a.k.a. plain English, this is what you need to know about this mighty machine:<br /><br />1. The manual needs a lot of work.  It's neither user-friendly nor idiot-proof.  Ditto for the boxy silver remote.<br /><br />2. It is easy to set up if you already know how to do that sort of thing.  (We have component video connections to the TV and digital coaxial connections to the receiver.)<br /><br />3. It gives excellent sound from both CDs and DVDs. With the benefit of 5.1 surround, movies like Master and Commander can literally move you, and CDs have never sounded better.<br /><br />4. It is as convenient as a 5-disc CD changer as it is a 5-disc DVD player, except that when you're playing more than one CD you'll need to put it in ""CD Mode"" first.<br /><br />5. It can easily play different types of media, such as audio Cds, MP3s, DVDs and those other mysterious formats - just put in the discs and play away.<br /><br />6. The video quality is very good on a regular TV.  You can set up different pre-defined picture quality modes, or customize to suit your own taste if you're a techie or a buff.  If you have difficulty making up your mind, ignore this option.<br /><br />7. The player is chock full of options, but you have to explore for yourself, which can be a bit confusing until you get the hang of it.  Read the manual, you say? See Item 1 above.<br /><br />8. There's on-screen information for MP3s and photo CDs, with different views available for the contents. (Groups/folders or entire playlists)<br /><br />9. I can't comment on the progressive scan feature, since I don't have an HD or HD-ready TV - yet. (Still waiting for that lottery win)<br /><br />10. It is supposed to play DVD-Audio discs, but you need 6.1 channel inputs on your receiver to play them. Unfortunately, our receiver is lacking these inputs, but then again, I am also lacking any DVD-Audio discs.<br /><br />Electronics buffs will probably say that it needs a bit of ""tweaking"" to get it to look and sound just right, but it looks and sounds great to me.  All in all a very good player, perhaps excellent when you factor in the price.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 1, 2004",positive,negative
B098B1LDXK,4.0,"[[VIDEOID:d3ebc84f3d3fd77b0d4bf01d2a1d3ade]] I had very specific needs/wants with a smart watch and this watch takes care of those.  However, I knew what I was getting into and it was a choice - appearance, size, basic function vs feature rich and huge!!!<br /><br />This is a beautiful watch that suits for a delicate, feminine appearance without being bulky. While not light, it is very comfortable to wear, even while sleeping.  My previous regular watch was a simple Timex Indiglo.  Small, silver, lovely and functional.  But I wanted the notifications and step tracking so I wouldn't need a separate fitness device.  I then got an ASUS Zenwatch 2.  Loved it!  Feature rich, great interface, but larger than I wanted and looked like a calculator on my wrist.  I lost it and have been attempting to find something to replace it.  I purchased a modern fashion smart watch, but the dial was huge and didn't suite my taste.  Then I found this one.  Right size, right look, right features (steps, find phone, notifications, etc).  I've had it a week and here's where I am.<br /><br />Physical - beautiful silver appearance with a delicate look.  Band is flexible, very comfortable and easy to put on and take off.  I have a 7"" wrist and removed one link using the INCLUDED link removal tool.  This is a fantastic add on to this watch.<br /><br />Display and interface - bright and clear.  Images are simple, but pleasing.  Fonts are nice.  Scroll is reasonably responsive.  Lots of options for faces including your own custom.  My only gripe with the faces is that I wish you could choose the custom features to display.  I would have liked a battery status with my custom image.  Touch screen is responsive, though I find my fingers are large and I have some issues periodically controlling the small buttons for stopwatch and timer.  Stopwatch and timer can't run in the background, so you can't scroll through the watch while using them.  Would need to set an alarm from the phone instead.  The find phone feature is virtually worthless.  If you're any distance from the phone then the Bluetooth disconnects and you can't send the find signal.<br /><br />Notifications - I am happy with notifications overall in that I actually receive them and can read enough to get the gist.  However, you can only see the last message received.  Also, you can only scroll to a set number of characters.  The messages are prefixed by all of the people in a thread.  So if you have a group of 6 people in a message, all of their names will be displayed, and then you'll see who sent the message, and then it will start the message, but it will be truncated to a limited number of characters.<br /><br />Phone app - leaves A LOT to be desired.  The grammar in English is awkward.  Determine to select, state for steps, etc.  The tracking is wonky in that it's per day and you have to select each day from the calendar.  There are no charting or trends with the exception of a chart for the single day of sleep.  Tracking for blood ox, BPM, and blood pressure in the phone only keeps if it's started from the phone.  If you start it from the watch, it doesn't log it.<br /><br />Battery - Goes for at least 3 days so far with the tilt-to-view and auto heart monitoring off.  I like that the charger is a plate that the watch sits in.<br /><br />Even with all of this, I am happy with my watch.  I know the limitations, but until there is a comparable alternative, I'm good with this one.",positive,positive

B004LJBDIE,4.0,"I work in photo/video for a living, so cases like these to travel with are an absolute necessity.  They feel relatively tough and rugged, however I hope that I never have to test the waterproof claim. When I first opened it, the rubber lining that I believe is used to keep it water tight was actually half detached and hanging. I had to feed it back into the groove it fits into, where it has stayed since. That's OK as I don't intend for this to suffer more than some light rain heading to/from a gig rather than survive a flood, but if the waterproof claim is what piqued your interest, perhaps a brand like Pelican would be a better wager.<br />Otherwise, this is a very decent and usable case for things I want to protect, such as lenses, batteries, microphones, etc.<br />NOTE: I was hoping my DJI Phantom 3 would fit in one of these, but it does not. I could have measured ahead of time and known that, but I got excited seeing the images here of others fitting their (smaller) drones in.

This is absolutely amazing. I hooked it up to my hdmi eArc port and I can control the volume from my tv remote. I wanted a quality sound bar that didn’t have a built in Alexa like the Bose or sonos. The Sonos requires you to have internet connection to work. I haven’t used the Bluetooth capabilities so I can’t comment on that.

B082L6KJ2J,5.0,"After adding new legs to my 65” Sony TV in order to have the sound bar below I realized the legs would not allow the sound bar to sit flat on the entertainment center.  I found a way to prop the sound bar so it would balance between the legs but it was not ideal.  When I saw these brackets I thought this just might be the solution I was looking for - and it was!<br /><br />First of all, let me say - I have had incredible luck with the Amazon Basics branded items.  Each and every time I have ordered one of these products the quality has been top notch, they include every possible accessory you could possibly need and the price is typically significantly lower than similar name brand items.  I have been so pleased with these branded items I actually check to see if there is an Amazon Basic item in whatever I’m ordering prior to purchasing.<br /><br />These brackets come with a multitude of nuts, bolts, metal and plastic washers and spacers.  Depending on the design of your TV and sound bar you may need a combination of what’s included.<br /><br />I was mounting a Sony sound bar to a Sony TV so I thought it would be fairly straight forward...  Well it still required that I attempt multiple configurations of bolts, spacers, washers and nuts.  Luckily EVERYTHING I needed was included in the packaging in order to get the speaker hung and have it level above the feet.<br /><br />These brackets will work great if your TV is suspended from a mount and you want your sound bar positioned above or below it.  The brackets are highly adjustable and will easily work with a wide array of TVs and sound bars.<br /><br />This is an awesome set of brackets for suspending a sound bar from your TV. I have been very pleased with this product.",positive,negative
B00VR2K9RO,5.0,"I have a good tangle of cables in my home office for a variety of devices that require a micro-USB cable. Most of these cables are very nondescript and I have no idea who made them, though there are a couple of them that have manufacturer names printed on the plugs on the end. Most are plain black and are mostly indistinguishable from one another. These cables from Magic-T are absolutely the most easily identifiable cables on the desk and it has made it very easy to assign cables to every device on the desk. But, there is more to these cables than just pretty colors.<br /><br />The most obvious advantage of this cable set is the colors. Each of these cables is a different color and none of them are black or gray - there’s blue, pink, orange and green. And, even more important than the color is the fact that they are insulated in nylon weave, not plastic coating, which in my experience holds up a bit better under stress and the result is a more reliable cable.<br /><br />The plugs on both ends are metal shielding with a plastic base, sufficient to give these strength for the connections. The cables have been inserted in the bases and attached within, not attached to the plug base, but those connections are very tight and seem to be solid so I am not concerned about them pulling loose.<br /><br />Each cable is about six and a half feet in length which is much more convenient for me than the regular 3' cables.<br /><br />These cables are capable of high-speed charging so if you have a device and a charger that are both capable of high-speed charging then these cables will work well for you. I used one for my tablet and a high-speed USB charger and the tablet did charge faster than when using a lower-grade cable.<br /><br />I want to mention the pricing. As I write this, the price on this set of four cables is about $9. That’s about $2.25 per cable, and the cables are of good quality. The price can change of course, but at the current price this is an absolute bargain.<br /><br />There’s something else I need to mention. The manufacturer offers a 12-month warranty on these cables, and to me that’s just amazing. For a cable that costs less than $2.50 per individual cable the manufacturer thinks enough of their product to back it with a 12-month warranty. I doubt I would ever need to use the warranty for one of these, but it’s reassuring to know the manufacturer believes in their products.<br /><br />It is hard to find fault with these cables. They are made well, they are easily identifiable and they are very inexpensive. This is a fine set at a great price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",positive,positive

B089LGSSW2,4.0,"While I've never bothered with a webcam before, having one now, in the middle of the pandemic, seems like it will be useful. As an old guy with a number of health issues, I am staying at home all the time and haven't been venturing out at all. Rather than actually going to the doctor's office these days, the webcam will allow me to teleconference routine medical checkups. It's also good for keeping in touch with family and friends I can't see face to face. Just this evening I spent time in a Google video chat room talking with a dear friend who lives in another part of the country. Then I checked in on Facebook video chat with one of my sisters. Talking with someone in a video chat is much nicer than chatting by text or visiting over a landline phone. So if you don't already have the capacity for video chatting, you might want to think about getting a webcam.<br /><br />On my Windows 10 desktop, this really is a plug and play piece of equipment. No software or other downloads needed. One of the minor issues has to do with setting this webcam up for the first time. The instructions are minimal and of no practical use. At first, I kept getting error messages when trying to use the webcam to make a video chat call, with no clear indication of what the error was. Some trial and error efforts showed it to be a simple problem. I needed to give the device both camera and mic access before it would work. Once I figured that out, I was easily able to make calls without any further error messages.<br /><br />Another minor issue was that when I first tried to put the webcam on my desk, it kept flipping over on its side. So I had to make my first video call holding it in my hands. Later, after the tight coiling of it's cord eased up, it sat just fine with no tipping.<br /><br />Then, if I held the device too close to the computer screen, sitting just over the speakers, the webcam would pick up enough of the other person's voice to set up a feedback echo. Moving the device away from the computer speakers easily solved that.<br /><br />Finally, the video on my end was okay but not great. I looked green but that may have something to do with the lighting in my room. Still, I loved chatting with my friend and my sister. Both enjoyed the fact that I looked so green and neither seemed to have any problem hearing me. This is the first webcam I've used and I'm pleased enough with it to give the device a 4 star rating.",positive,negative

When it’s time for a replacement, I do look to see what other options are out there…but I just keep coming back to this one.<br /><br />It’s comfortable in my hand and responds well to my touch. The only reason I need to replace it is because I often eat at my desk and sometimes that’s hard on a mouse.

It rolls nicely and the battery life lasts quite a while. I like the little green light on the top to tell me it still has a charge.<br /><br />I use a basic mouse pad with a built-in wrist rest and my hand and arm do not feel any strain. The rubberized grip really helps me hold onto it comfortably.<br /><br />I have seen this mouse in other patterns but I stick with this dark gray version.

The sound was great. Then I went to the app store and downloaded the MYSOUND app and got caught up in the app. They have pre-customized downloads that can change the way your music is played. So I listened to a song with about 20 different sound customizations. Cool beans. Then I connected the headphones to my pc. Again, easy peezy and I can go to the phone or the tablet without losing either connection to my iPhone. When I went back to the iPhone, I did lose my connection to my laptop. The only thing I did not do, was add the shirt connector or use the cord clips to take up slack in the back. I will do that later. Now, being winter time, I could not get sweat to determine how they did with sweat. The only thing I would like to see an improvement on, is noise cancellation, I guess if you are doing sports, you probably don't want that though, so that you can be more aware of your surroundings. Right now, these are my favorites!",positive,positive
B07QD3B6XJ,1.0,"Not really for the Galaxy Buds. They barely fit into the buds and cause them to stick further out of your ear. About as comfortable as having an ant crawl in your ear as well.<br /><br />The Buds tips fit down over the top of the Bud, these fit on the end. I've used foam tips with other earbuds and these are amount the worst. They barely expand once put it, and if they do deal at all they stay when removing the Bud from your ear. That was fun...",negative,negative
B07GVCZPSJ,1.0,I tried Jaybird products three times and ultimately they are not as good as they were. The Jaybird X3 was the last pair of headphones that were made correctly. The X4 came out and quality control was terrible. I’ve bought two pairs of the X4s and they both had the same issue. My x3s lasted two years with daily use 5 days a week two hours a day. Don’t buy any Jaybird products as this brand has fallen off.,negative,negative
B07Y9SVH6T,5.0,"This works great to split the audio signal out of an HDMI feed- we use it to send audio to our surround sound system while using our home projector for an immersive theater experience. We used to have an Amazon Basics version of the same thing, but it did not work very well- sometimes the Amazon version would need to be set via a button to change 5.1 or 2 channel or passthrough sound since it wouldn't always remember the setting after a power down, but this unit has a physical switch so it will be hardcoded upon power on. Also sometimes with the Amazon version the sound wouldn't pass through to the video device (it would always send sound out the analog audio jacks, but only sometimes also out the HDMI- it is supposed to do both). This one seems to consistently do both, as it should.<br />I'd like to also add that THIS COMES WITH EVERYTHING! It has Two HDMI cables, a digital audio cable, an analog cable, etc, ALL IN THE BOX. A fantastic package that does exactly what you want.",positive,positive

B01DSSLEHI,5.0,"Never thought I would want an all-in-one computer because you can't expand it at all, but with USB you don't really need to, as you can add external USB drives or devices (printers, scanners, etc.) easily or even use USB flash drives.  Of course you can't add memory, but this comes with 8 gig, which is really all you need these days, unless you are a gamer.  This has a nice large display screen with a clear picture.  Will be great for watching video.  Has a built in microphone and video camera.  Tried the microphone with Windows 10 assistant Cortana and it works great (even though it warned me that it might not).  Comes with Windows 10 pre-installed.  All you have to do is customize a few local settings (time zone, language, etc.) and you are ready to go.  Because everything is built in to the screen, setup time is very fast.  You plug it in and turn it on.  You do have to put batteries in the wireless mouse and keyboard, but they are included, as was the USB stick needed for the wireless devices.  Was up and running in no time.  The wireless mouse and keyboard is nice, but the keyboard is a flat keyboard and I much prefer an ergo keyboard, so I probably won't use the keyboard.  My biggest problem in the past with wireless devices is that they go through batteries fast.  This keyboard and mouse have on/off switches, so you aren't using up the battery when you aren't using the computer.  With everything built into one unit, you might think it would be pretty heavy.  It is heavy, but most people could move it without difficulty.  There is a lot to like about this system and not much to dislike.  I was disappointed that it didn't have more USB ports.  There were only 2 on the back and 2 on the side.  One of the 4 is used for a tiny USB stick that is used for wireless communication with the keyboard and mouse.  You'll quickly run out of USB ports, so you may need a USB hub, if you have more than a couple of devices to hook up.  The 500 gig hard drive is a little small by today's standards, but should be big enough for most people.  For lots of data storage an external source is really more ideal than saving on the C: drive.  You might be able to get a little more computer for less money, but it seems to me that the pricing is not that bad, considering what you get.  Also includes McAfee internet security and some cloud storage (although small and you have to do things to increase it or pay for more space).  Overall not a bad value and ideal for limited space.  No cords and wires to deal with.  You have only the power cord to deal with.  I was also impressed that it included an optical drive.  Many newer systems (especially laptops) don't include a DVD drives anymore.  Performance seemed a little slow, but nothing significant.  I think most people will be happy with this system and it will meet the needs of all but the most demanding users.",positive,negative
B00JJVG08W,4.0,"I own the [[ASIN:B00MVXUACM Koss SP330 On Ear Dynamic Headphones Black with Silver Accents]] (current price $105.52) and I love them because of their comfort, good sound, and overall quality.  I selected these headphones because I wanted to have a spare set and also to see how these would compare to my Koss.<br /><br />I tried these headphones on the iPhone 5, iPad 3, and a Dell Latitude E6430 laptop and on all of these devices the sound was fabulous. It was actually more stereo sounding than my Koss.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- The stereo sound is crisp and slightly better than my Koss.<br /><br />- I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the electric blue color which is called ""candy blueberry.""<br /><br />- A headphone port on each earpiece provides the user with the ability to share the headphones by plugging in a music share cable which is NOT PROVIDED. A music share cable is not really needed in my opinion because all headphones come with one cable. While my boyfriend was listening to music on his iPad, I just plugged in my Koss cable to the side of the headset he was not using, and listened to the same music through my Koss headphones while he was using these.<br /><br />- I like that the provided headphone cable can be used in the left or right earpiece which enables me to switch sides when I want.<br /><br />- The headphone cable has an in-line MIC control for Android, tablets and other devices.  Based on my research, an in-line MIC means there's a built in microphone that is built into the cable which should enable the wearer to answer calls without removing the headphones. I was able to get this to work on my boyfriend's iPad and iPhone and he was able to talk and hear through the headphones.  There is a one button control on the in-line MIC which lowered the volume.<br /><br />- The headphone band is adjustable.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- The only CON I see is that they are not as comfortable for me as I would have liked. I used these a few times for a period of several hours. Even though they can be adjusted, I wound up getting a headache with extended use (more than 2 hours). So in this sense they were not as comfortable as they initially feel when just putting them on. The Koss headphones I own are the only ones I've ever tried that have been comfortable on me.<br /><br />OTHER THINGS TO NOTE:<br /><br />- The Amazon product page says that a music share cable is included; this is not correct nor is it really needed because if you are sharing just plug in a cable from another pair of headphones to the extra port on these.<br /><br />- According to the manual, it takes 20 hours for the headphones to break in. It says the sound mellows out over time.<br /><br />In summary, these headphones are great. They have fantastic stereo sound (at least to my ears), the ability to share by plugging in another set of headphones, and an in-line MIC. They are adjustable and relatively comfortable but not as comfortable as my Koss.  The color is also attractive.",positive,positive
B0BBMLH3QY,5.0,I am really enjoying the sound quality from these as I needed to switch from a corded headset to something wireless. This is Bluetooth but the Bluetooth chip works well and doesn’t seem to have issue where it disconnects from my laptop and connects to my phone (I’ve had this with a few speakers).<br /><br />The mic works great as I do user testing and the sound quality is important for good feedback as a tester.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the chip isn’t needed unless Bluetooth isn’t available on the device. There was no issue with connectivity either as my laptop recognizes the USB Bluetooth chip and automatically paired with the headset. A plus for me since my laptop tends to lag.<br /><br />The headset has a good/decent look to it. The earpieces are squishy and comfortable. The headset adjusts easily. The plastic seems to be of decent quality so putting them on and taking off repeatedly should not be an issue. Very pleased overall.,positive,positive

B00IDYS0ZM,4.0,"This case has a great adjustable shoulder strap and has a solid velcro loop on the back so you can attach it to a belt or bag. This case is built really well, but it is much smaller than I anticipated.  First, let me qualify this review by saying if you own the professional line of lenses, then some lenses might not fit.  I shoot with a Canon 5D III and almost all my lenses I have are the L series.  Some did not fit at all.  For example, my Canon 85mm f/1.2L lens would not fit in the case at all, and my Canon 50mm f/1.2L was so snug at the top that it felt like it would have been forced in there.  The case narrows a lot at the bottom.  This is ideal for some lenses because it keeps your lenses more secure, but for most of my lenses, it was a tough fit.  It did fit my 135mm, 24-105mm f/4L, 17-40mm, and my 100mm Macro lenses in it perfectly. So, it will work for most lenses that are no more than 3 inches in diameter for the glass (about a 77mm thread) and I would say no taller than 4.5 to possibly 5 inches.  It's built really well and is a nice little case, so I would recommend on this condition to just pay close attention to the size and match it up with your gear.",positive,positive
B07Y1SZJHC,5.0,"I've bought a lot of radios on Amazon; I've had to return most of them for very poor quality including impossible tuning.  This is one of the ones I kept.  All the features work and I'm currently listening to it while charging it with my phone micro usb cord.  I especially love the 2 color lights to function.  It sounds really good,  better than cheaper bigger radios I've tried,  and it's built more solidly than they were.  The tuning is feather light touch and much easier than the others with less static and a harder to get classical station I like comes in clearer.  You're not going to listen to it from your pocket because just handling it the tuning knob will change frequencies; you have to treat it like a table radio.  But it performs as one,  admirably.  Bluetooth connects easily,  sounds great and the whole radio is a joy.  I believe this brand also makes a larger size portable/ table radio with a handle I'll have to try as I've not found a good one yet.  But this is at the top of my keepers.",positive,positive

B0045FM6SU,5.0,"First and foremost- What every prospective tablet user needs to consider: What am I planning on doing with my tablet?<br />For most users, tablets are for entertainment and are considered a luxury item.  They aren't good for working on school work, or anything that requires a lot of typing, so for most people, these devices are for consuming media (news, videos, social networks...).<br /><br />Why pick the Wifi only:<br />When I was looking at Xooms at the local electronics establishment, I was confronted with the decision of getting the $599 Xoom Wifi or the $799 Xoom 3G/Wifi (upgradeable to 4G at a later date at no cost).  For me, while 3G was tempting for convenience, it was still a pretty easy decision to buy the Wifi only device.  With the 3G, you are tied into a service contract.  If you go with Verizon's service (which is advertized with the device), you only pay $599 for the device, but you have to pay $20 a month for 24 months.  On top of that, you can only use 1GB of data.  For a device that is going to be used for the consumption of data (especially videos), I don't want to be limited to only 1GB.  Another decision point was the fact that I knew my Xoom would be used mostly at home, where I have a Wifi network, or at local eatting establishments that provide free Wifi.  The real nail in the coffin on this decision was that my 4G phone is capable of wireless teathering and my data plan is unlimited- taking that into consideration- there really is no need to pay for an additional data plan.<br /><br />The Device- an out of the box look:<br />Out of the box, you find the approximately 1.5 lbs device, power cable, and a couple booklets.  I would have been nice to have a sleeve for the Xoom, but Motorola doesn't provide any type of protection for the tablet.  I made sure to pick up a [[ASIN:B004S748UY ZAGG invisibleSHIELD for Motorola Xoom (Screen) (MOTXOOMS)]] to make sure my screen stayed pristine.  The device is a solid little tablet.  The back id 4/5 aluminum and the top part of the back case is rubberized plastic.<br /><br />The hardware feels solid.  Additionally, the layout of the device generally makes sense.  The power button was a little confusing, but once I found it on the back, the idea really grew on me.  It will be a little wierd when it comes to accessories, but I have no complaint about the device itself.  Next to the power button, there is the HD camera lense with LED flash.  Having an HD camera is nice, even if shooting pictures on a tablet isn't really practicle.  The back of the device also includes stero speakers that are surprisingly loud for a device of this size.<br /><br />All of the connectors (power, usb, dock...) are all located on the bottom of the device, except the headphone jack.  Not sure I am a fan of this oddity, but I have yet to use headphones, so it is not really an issue to date.  Also, the volme buttons are located on the left side of the device and are sufficiently easy to reach and use.<br /><br />On the face of the device, there is a forward facing camera- this is great for video chatting.  While GTalk works, Skype currently does not support video chat on this device (app issue, not hardware).  There is also a light senseor- I hate the light sensor- I sometimes find that the brightness of the screen changes abruptly by a huge amount because I accidently put my thumb over the sensor.  The best fix for this is to just turn off the auto adjustment.<br /><br />Orientation:<br />Deviating from the norm, the Xoom is built to be oriented in landscape mode rather than portrait mode.  With the 10 inch screen, landscape works great.  I find that I am able to thumb type on the on-screen keyboard without straining much to reach the keys in the middle.  The size is really what makes landscape work well with this tablet.  In portrait, I (like many others) find that the device is a little bit hard to balance- feeling a little top heavy.  It isn't so bad that the device is difficult to use- it just takes a little getting used to.<br /><br />Android:<br />The android 3.0, Honeycomb load on this device is great.  Many who don't use android or are iPad users will probably find that the device will take a little bit of learning to get used to.  I am an android user (though my phone has an older version of android), and found that I was able to fully use and understand the device in 30 minutes of playing with it.  The learning period may take up to a day, but once you fiure it out, you will notice that the controls really make sense and are easy to find when you need them.<br /><br />Overall, I love this little device.  There are some minor little design dislikes, but nothing that impacts my 5 star rating of this device!",positive,negative

Plus, I can now use it for my iPod, mobile phone, zoom meetings, etc....<br />I also watch a lot of movies on my desktop computer and it really adds great sound. I was not sure about this brand as there are so many look a likes on the market, but I have seen this in my friends house and he was very happy with it so I figured I give it a try. Amazon has 30 days free returns anyway.<br /><br />The set up is very easy. You can use physical wires, or the Bluetooth connection. This Saiyin soundbar, just after using for a little while of use, has been truly phenomenal. Yes, there are always better ones on the market, but this one is pretty decent. Also great for parties, or just listening to my Spotify / iTunes music or movies. The best part is that I can also watch movies on my phone and still get a full loud cinema sound.

B003BEDTBE,4.0,"My first GPS was a hand me down Magellan that I could never get to work.  My second was a Navigon 2100 max 4.3-Inch Portable GPS Navigator with Text-to-Speech which I absolutely love.  Next was the Nextar SNAP5 Super Slim 5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator which I seldom use.  This TomTom XL 340M LIVE (Lifetime Maps Edition) 4.3-Inch Portable GPS Navigator is better than all, but I still love the Navigon for it's quick re-routing  and ease of operation.  That being said, I'll describe my experiences over the past few weeks of owning this GPS.<br /><br />Out of the box, it's necessary to hook the GPS up to your computer to check on the maps and register the product.  I did remove the extra voices to create some space as was recommended by other reviewers, saving them to my computer before removing them from the device.  I wasted time trying to find Tom Tom Home and like another reviewer, was able to get it through an internet search.  The website listed on the box (as I recall) was not accurate and it's not intuitive.  Once I had the software downloaded and installed, I began confirming that I had the most recent map installed.  This can be done only once.  I reviewed the online manual because there was none included and that was no big deal for me.  No papers to lose.  Although I did not register for the Live option or provide any information (payment), I've used the live services to do a Google search for a POI and the gas prices has already been used 3 times with success.  I'm not crazy about having the computerized female voice as the only option for ""speaking"" street names, and the names are not always pronounced correctly or even completely, but it does work.  The Navigon is far superior in this regard.  The Tom Tom accesses satellites very quickly for me and I don't find myself waiting ever for the device to start navigating.  The POIs are far superior and easier to access on the Tom Tom.  Rerouting options were not intuitive for me and a friend showed me the way to select specific options.  The mount is lousy in my opinion and the GPS has popped out on too many occasions for me to be comfortable.  It's the weakest link for me in the entire package.  I did have the audio set to automatically change with the speed of the vehicle but that drove me crazy with a computerized female voice yelling at me as I was driving the Beltway, so that's been changed and she's set at about 70% consistently.  I wish I'd had this GPS a week earlier because I received a $150 speeding ticket in the mail from DC through a Radar unit.  Once I recover from the shock and guilt, I'll travel the route again within the speed limit and see if the GPS warns me of the radar unit.  It does alert me of the red light camera installed (but not operational) which is permanently installed on my street corner.  The first few times I heard the alert, I had no idea what was going on, until I read the online manual again.  I now also set the speed alert to let me know when I'm exceeding a speed limit, but the limits have not always been current.  One day, I will notify Tom Tom of several routing major screw ups I've discovered but that's going to have to wait until I have some time on my hands.  The Navigon is superior in this regard of more direct routing and fewer errors.  All in all, I like this and would recommend the product.  Perhaps when my Navigon Fresh Maps subscription expires I'll remove the second GPS from my car, but for now I just can't give up Sarah (the Navigon text to speech voice).",positive,negative

B07FY4T24Z,3.0,"Disclaimer - I've only had these for about a week so far and these are the very first Truly Wireless Earbuds that I have ever owned.<br /><br />I purchased these earbuds on a great sale while waiting for another more expensive brand to get restocked, and honestly didn't expect to much from these. First impressions were that they were quite cheap however after using them for a little while now, I've come to appreciate them even more. Even though these are my very first Truly Wireless Earbuds, I feel that after tons of research and watching reviews, I know what to look for in sound and quality. There are so many budget wireless earbuds on the market right now with so many more on Indigogo (which from comments and reviews I've seen and read,  I will NEVER buy from). This makes it quite hard to know what to buy. For me, I have been waiting for that perfect very small and discreet Truly Wireless Earbud with amazing sound. The Iyesku YK-T02 TWS Sport Earbuds didn't hit that mark for me but at the price I paid, I honestly can't complain.<br />Pros:<br />1. Bluetooth 5.0 - This was one of my main requirements when searching and the YK-T02 has it.<br />2. Easy to pair (I am using the Samsung Note 8) and pairing was very easy. Once the buds are initially paired, they connect super fast once you pull them out of the charging case.<br />3. No loss of connectivity to either earbud. I've seen a bunch of reviews where this is an issue with MANY other wireless earbuds on the market. Even some of the more spendy ones.<br />4. Fit is very comfortable and seem to be very secure though I have not put them through the test of running nor exercise. However I don't think this would be an issue at all.<br />5. Sound quality is decent. More about this in the Cons.<br />6. Tons of ear tip options. Most earbuds come with a few extra sizes but these come with a plethora, for that perfect custom fit.<br />7. Quite small and discreet.<br />8. Small pocketable charging case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Sound. As I stated in the Pros these sound ""good"" (for the money) but the Highs are quite loud (Mids and Bass are not) and almost hurt when the volume is turned all the way up. Mids are not to bad but the bass is nearly non existent which was a huge let down. HOWEVER let me say, once I played with the ear tips and found the right fit, Highs, Mids, and Bass are much better, but still not what I would have hoped for but again these aren't ""High end"" earbuds right?<br />2. Because the volume of these buds are quite low, Audio books are hard to hear when in a loud environment.<br />3. No satisfying magnet to hold the buds in the charging case like many others on the market. (The case does click shut to ensure the buds wont be falling out.)<br />4. Speaking of the case, my first impression was that the case felt very nice and lightweight, but it does feel cheap.<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br />Like I said earlier in this review, if you can get these from Amazon on a lightning deal or with a coupon, I would say grab you a pair, but just don't expect these to compete with higher end buds. These would be great for the kids and anyone that just wants a good pair of Truly Wireless Earbuds that wont break the bank.",positive,positive
B004I8WH9M,3.0,"This speaker we use when we want sound enhancement to watching YouTube, which does a great job in enhancing the volume, but sound quality is just so so.  Now with Apple Tv you can flick YouTube onto your Telly. Would I carry this speaker on the go, nope.  Easy to use, just connect the plug and away you go.  Useful if you want to Skype with friends and family as it does enhance the audio for you if you are hard of hearing!",positive,negative
B009HB2USI,5.0,"Needed a receiver that would allow us to have a decent sub (not expensive), fill the room with sound efficiently and have enough HDMI hookups for DirecTV, 3D Blu Ray, gaming when needed, that had airplay and was easy to use remote.<br />Plus was at a decent price.<br /><br />H/K AVR1700 met those expectations. It was between this, Yamaha 473 or 573 units or Pioneer 1122. I went w/ Harman Kardon based on reviews, price and expectations of use. I have a 7.2 system that can shake the house in the basement for sports, movies etc. Our LG 47LM8600 would be matched to the system and we realized we didn't need anything more than 5.1 for the Living Room based on setup downstairs and with our L/R being somewhat small and open to dining/kitchen this unit would be a good match.<br /><br />1. I missed getting this at the $200 sale price, but willingly paid the $270 price to get it via prime and have the Living Room up and running for wife and family. I would expect as the 2013 receivers come out the sales price will return.<br /><br />2. First set of speakers was the Polk Audio RM6750 HT speaker set. Unfortunately 2 were shot rather quickly. RMA returned to Newegg and got different speakers to match receiver from Amazon. Polk Audio PSW505 Sub (which works great with the 1700's LFE sub Hookup), BIC Center channel to match my Axiom M2 Bookshelves I brought down from the loft game system and the two additional Polk Audio RM6750 satellites for the rears.  - H/K auto setup worked like a champ for surround sound, but for our setup I tweaked it a bit for the subwoofer. Easily done in manual mode.<br /><br />3. Setup the Panasonic 3D Blu Ray via HDMI - no issues, You can even match names to HDMI inputs on back so they match the buttons on remote.<br /><br />4. Setup DirecTV inputs (SAT/Cable) - no issues worked well and we can get 5.1 sound on channels that have it encoded.<br /><br />5. HDMI out to LG tv. didn't' realize doing this at first took away the TV's sound. Which is OK since receiver sounds better than plain tv. it just requires another remote to be used for the process. Later today I'll look at making either or both the DirecTV / Harman Kardon Remotes universal for the system and thus streamline the 4 remotes we have out.<br /><br />6. Remote is OK, buttons are somewhat readable for an older couple but reading glasses help til I have them memorized. switching things around and getting to H/K's setup required downloading and reading parts of the manual. Yes it doesn't come with the system. I had to download it. 8mb file<br /><br />Overall - Very good purchase so far (3 weeks). Good sound - probably a bit more tweaking to do yet. Since it feels like the volume is about half way up for a presentable sound. was same w/ Polk Audio speakers too.<br />Easy to use, remote is decent (not great), wife said it looks good and there aren't a bunch of buttons for the grandson to see and go and try to push. it seems streamlined in looks.<br /><br />cons - Manual had to be downloaded to figure out a couple of buttons and &#34;How - to's&#34;. I missed the very low sales price.",positive,negative
B0B5L5ZQBN,5.0,"Anyone with a phone that is missing the headphone jack knows just how annoying that is.

B07N2JWLQ6,4.0,"I prefer to use a camera that is separate from my smartphone in most cases (though having a camera on my phone does come in handy). My DSLR also has a video mode but again I’d rather keep that separate, in this case because of the SD card capacity. I was interested in this video camera, mainly because it has the features I need in a video camera and it is relatively inexpensive. So far it has proven to be worth its asking price. It is not a high-end camera by any means but it is fine for general use and it is priced reasonably.<br /><br />I’ll start with listing what’s in the box: the camera, a remote control for the camera, the microphone with foam wind guard, a cable to connect the microphone to the camera body, batteries for everything (3 different kinds), a carrying case, a 32GB SD card (not sure what class), a USB cable, an HDMI cable and a user’s manual for the camera as well as the microphone. Everything you need to get started is already in the box.<br /><br />The camera is very lightweight, more so than my Sony camera which is more solid and heavy. The Sony also cost several times more. The light weight and plastic housing makes this camera feel somewhat cheap, though that is more cosmetic. The weight is actually an advantage as it helps with one-handed filming where a heavier camera would cause fatigue faster.<br /><br />This is a 24MP digital camera and while that is not the best resolution available it is better than I would expect at this price point. Video comes out clear and smooth for the majority of projects. If you really need a higher resolution (in which case you’re probably doing more professional work) you likely will need to spend much more.<br /><br />One area of disappointment for me with this camera is the lack of optical zoom. The zoom is purely digital and in my experience a digital zoom solution is never as clear and accurate as an optical zoom. This camera is no exception and I find the digital zoom to be almost useless to me. It has some uses when not zoomed far, but when zooming in closer and closer it becomes clear that the image quality suffers.<br /><br />The camera does have a fairly comprehensive menu system and is easy to navigate. I did find the user manual mildly helpful in better understanding what the camera can do for me.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent little camera, especially when considering that the cost is quite low. It is not a top of the line camera and it does lack an optical zoom, but for the price point it is a decent consideration if you need a video camera suitable for taking on vacation or for class projects.",positive,negative
B00F2ENU92,5.0,"I can't even put into words how much I love this tablet.  I have an iPad and also had an Asus tablet that was a huge piece of junk.

The sound is Dolby Digital and the graphics are better than some tv's I have in my house.  I love the stand that is attached but the best part is the battery life.  I can go a full week without charging the tablet even when watching movies.  If you use the tablet for general use it will give you about 20 hours of battery life.

Now reading the reviews I'm concerned it may be a lamp problem too. I think it's the battery, however but this really upsets me since I paid for a working battery and didn't get one. I feel CHEATED, but it's probably just poor product quality control. Now I have to buy a new battery because they sent me a faulty product. Also there's no indicator light on the battery like the ad and instructions say there would be. And the cord to charge the light is very short.

There isn't even a storage space for the USB receiver it was shipped loose, rattling about in the battery compartment.<br /><br />The mouse works. It fits my thick, stubby fingered hand okay.

B08DW2SJCQ,4.0,"I purchased these primarily for use with MS Teams and other conference calls while working from home since people occasionally complained about audio from my Apple AirBook and AirPods (and other Bluetooth headsets).  Long story short - No more complaints!<br /><br />Noise cancellation due to ambient room noise is very good.  Other conversations even in close proximity seem to be muted fairly well.  Since these do not go in your ear, there is not reduction in room noise for you— only for people on the other end of the call.<br /><br />i also hoped to be able to listen to music and other audio while working with them.  Sound quality is good for news but is lacking for music.  At high volumes, music with a lot of bass will cause an annoying vibration.<br /><br />Other features:  + I like being able to answer and hangup with a button press., - I’ve yet to figure out if it’s even possible to advance to the next music track, -I got it to connect to 2 devices simultaneously once but haven’t been able to do it again and couldn’t figure out how to switch between the two.",positive,negative

B00ET8FP68,5.0,"To mention right off the bat, I am not even an amateur radio operator, just someone who enjoys radio. I find radio to be far more romantic and compelling than modern methods of broadcasting. Staying up late in the night and turning the dial with the soft glow of the tuner, the sound of static and mystery that can sometimes accompany radio broadcasts offers something truly genuine that you can't get anywhere else today. That feeling is priceless and not duplicable (If that was even a word).<br /><br />Anyway, this radio is good quality and contains the capability needed to reach further than most others. If you enjoy radio as I do, a clock radio, ghetto blaster or home stereo won't cut it. If you know what I am talking about, then this radio is for you. I've stayed up many nights listening to Coast to Coast AM on the internet, but it lacked the feeling something like this radio will bring you. I was unable to pick up a station on my home stereo to listen to CTC and was forced to use the internet. The internet provided a clear, stereo sounding broadcast and was very clear.<br /><br />The CC Radio has been spoken about on the program for many years. I finally picked one up and am very pleased with it's performance. I can now pick up the radio broadcast of Coast to Coast AM and with all the nuances I expect of a a late night radio broadcast. When interesting speakers talk about compelling topics, a crystal clear internet broadcast does not move you inside. However, using the CC Radio, the slight static, the slight fading in and out and all other fantastic experiences you can only receive using a real radio, it has the ability to make you feel and even send chills up your spine. There is just something a good solid radio can do for you that nothing else can and the CC Radio delivers on that 100%.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed and I really need to get my license.",positive,positive

B000T5GBK4,3.0,"This low-priced, ""no frills"" stereo audio/video cable, offered by TedUnlimited LLC, comes without any retail packaging (no annoying plastic bubble or clamshell).  The cable (red, white, yellow RCA connectors) seems to perform exactly the same as the equivalent cables that arrived with my cable box, VCR, and DVD player.  The picture and audio quality is perfectly satisfactory (no noise, adequate volume) when used with a small (26"") Sony HD TV.<br /><br />The RCA plugs have wafer-thin curved metal ""prongs"" instead of solid rings, and do not connect to the sockets quite as tightly as do the solid-ring plugs on my other cables.  The plugs look like the plugs on this similar--and possibly the same--product: [[ASIN:B000V0DY70 RiteAV - Audio Video RCA Cable 3ft]]. If your VCR, DVD, TV, and cable box are close together, the three-foot cable length is a big plus, because there is less cable to add to the cable tangle in back.<br /><br />I purchased this cable as a replacement for a defective one left by the cable guy that was delivering too-soft audio.  The cable is perfectly satisfactory for my simple, ordinary setup.  It gets a 3.5 rating, rounded down to a 3 (it's okay), but it could easily be rounded up to a 4 (I like it) because of the low price.",positive,positive

This audio cable is awesome just for the braided cord alone because I go through these cables at least one every two months because they keep breaking at the ends. This one I think might actually last because there isn't a way for it to break. It works great too and is tip top quality.

B00HFRYAMK,4.0,"I received one of these as a review sample and for what it does it deserves a full five stars.However, I am docking a star because there is a learning curve, due in part to sketchy documentation. I''ll get the challenges out of the way first.<br /><br />Even with the included documentation it's difficult to figure out some aspects of this case. Some examples: there is a pull strap on the hard, snap-in holder for the iPad that is held in place by two labels that say 'do not tear'. That strap is intended to remain as is and the friction and pressure of the iPad will hold it in place. The instructions do not mention this and I removed it anyway because it looked like a temporary shipping solution.<br /><br />Secondly, there are adjustable straps on the right and left sides of the case that prevent it from fully opening and remaining open. They are probably unnecessary and do create confusion. This case is not designed to fully open like a conventional case - it's designed to slide the iPad in and out using the T-shaped track. If you do want to use this as a conventional case you need only unfasten the two side straps and it will operate as such.<br /><br />On the plus side, this case if one of the best I have come across with respect to protection. You can literally drop it from shoulder height and it will protect your iPad. The shoulder strap is designed to function as a set of pockets as well as a comfortable way to carry your iPad. And the material from which this case is constructed is  built to take a lot of abuse and last much longer than your iPad.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a little over complicated and under documented in my opinion. However it's also ideal for folks who need a fairly rugged case. While the video on this page implies the target customer is a business user I think it's more ideally suited to first responders and folks who work in harsh environments.",positive,negative

I would love to be able to take the control unit off the 2 and place it on the 3. I often do not get the controls to work on the first time, too spongy feeling for my preference.

B003GSLEJO,5.0,"These speaker pins were exactly what was needed to connect our stranded wire to the spring clip connectors on our speakers. Constructed like a Banana Plug, the pin head guarantees a good connection. The color coded males come 2 to a box, enough to hook up a pair of speakers. Being a staight pin reduces the chance of crossing the leads. The price is very low and includes fast shipping. Sring clip connectors have some shortcomings.  Unless the wire is cleanly stripped and cut to exacting lengths, strands of wire can be loose and short the hot to ground leads.  Also, they can be inconvenient as the wires must be disconnected when moving the speakers or cleaning and dusting near them.  The more often the leads are reconnected, the less the tension holding the wire becomes.  These shortcomings can create noise, stastic, even cause an amplifier to turn off or cause component repair problems.

B01GYZ0Z0Y,4.0,"I received this as a free review sample. Since Vince McLaren's exceptionally helpful review of August 21, 2016 covers what I also discovered, take the time to read his (and mark it helpful because he did an excellent job.)<br /><br />It took me a few weeks to get around to writing this review because I needed to order an adapter for the 1998 Ford Explorer it was destined for, and also to have it professionally installed. The adapter I purchased is [[ASIN:B01ES32D7C Fits Ford Explorer 1998-2001 Double DIN Stereo Harness Radio Install Dash Kit]].  There are other kits by different brands for most vehicles. One of those will allow you to install (or have professionally installed) in older vehicles where this system will add some modern touches.<br /><br />The reasons why I subtracted a star are the touchscreen is not as sensitive as I had hoped (not unusable, but frustrating sometimes), and the instructions are not that great. A professional will have no problem installing this unit, and there is a comprehensive wiring diagram in the product photos on this page. If you are planning to do the install yourself, refer to that photo to get an idea of the complexity of the job.<br /><br />For me, the bluetooth capability and radio make this is great bargain in my opinion. I have a back-up camera that attaches to a license plate holder that adds that feature (you will need to provide your own camera, but they are inexpensive.) While this will display videos, you will need to load them via the TF card slot because this has no DVD (or CD) slot for that kind of media. Frankly, streaming music via bluetooth obviates the need for a CD (in my opinion), and I do not foresee myself ever needing to use any video player in the driver/front passenger compartment of a vehicle. If those are important to you, this is not the in-dash solution for you.<br /><br />My overall impression is this is a good - and very inexpensive - solution for upgrading in-dash entertainment and hands free solutions in older vehicles. Before you plunk down your money, though, make sure that this will fit your vehicle, and that there is an adapter kit available for installing it in your vehicle's make, model and year.",positive,negative

So far it has worked out well for me and it seems to work as designed, and with no tweaks or software installation required.<br /><br />This little unit is small and it easily fits in a shirt pocket though the cord does impact the way it fits in said pocket. It’s a little bigger than a comb but smaller than a candy bar.  It feels solid and well-made and so far has shown no signs of fatigue or weakness.<br /><br />I plugged it in and the fit was very snug so I had to work with it to get it plugged in properly. That’s actually a positive – it should not come unplugged unexpectedly when I move my laptop or plug something else into it, a problem I have had on occasion with MicroUSB devices.<br /><br />Windows recognized it immediately and it didn’t seem to need any extra device drivers or anything to make it work. It picked up the Ethernet interface as well as the USB hub, and that’s really all I would expect before plugging in anything else. The card reader works and I was able to read images off of the card I use in my camera through this device.<br /><br />I have not yet tried it under Linux but that’s coming shortly.

B09WYHSPYT,5.0,"I bought this for my son who is going to camp this year.  I wanted him to be able to record some memories with his friends and capture the beauty of the forest.  I know my son well enough to know that he might lose it so I didn't want to spend a lot.  This is definitely budget friendly,  but it is a much better camera than I expected and it came with extra accessories.  The set includes a tripod,  a carrying case,  and an extra battery.  The attached microphone has a cover to protect it from the wind so it's a great choice for the outdoors.  It's very easy to use and the picture quality is better than I hoped.  It even has a zoom feature.",positive,positive
B000KKXRJQ,5.0,"Had one for over a year now and bought a second one for a private bedroom in case something happens in there. The buttons and dialer are great and will work the distance probably in any size house. The speaker phone part is not as sensitive as I would like, if you fall in one room and push the button, it's hard to hear a person that fell if they are too far away from the speakerphone part that is in the base unit. That's why I bought a second one. I did a lot of research among these with both a monthly plan and just the dialer like this one, and this unit is far better then almost all the others I looked into. My dad wears his on a Necklace around his neck<br /><br />AND - about 6 months ago in 2012 - it probably saved my 94 year old Father's life !! Just like on TV, he fell and just couldn't get up by himself - pushed the button to call me - and I heard him in the background saying what happened and in 5 minutes I was there helping him. AND, if we weren't home or not close by his house, he also has the red emergency button for 911 if he couldn't reach us. That red one always works and tells 911 something is wrong and the location.<br /><br />It Works !! and it's not just for old people that might fall down or worse, you can program it to call anyone and also has many other programing options. Definitely a great unit.",positive,positive

B07Z82LM7K,3.0,"I got excited to see one of these small portable LED style ones that actually had a decent native resolution (most of them can accept 1080p, but are in reality only 800x600 resolution, or sometimes worse... 640x480!). This one is actually capable of displaying 720p of real dot resolution, which should make it at least as sharp as my Viewsonic and other traditional HD projectors. Ok, perhaps I'm spoiled, but I'm comparing this to our Viewsonic 720p projector that, to be fair cost me 3-4x as much.<br />And for the most part, it DOES work, however there are some caveats to its use. First of all, it doesn't seem as sharp as my 720p projector, even though it should have the requisite amount of dots. It's OK, its definitely better than the cheap 600p projectors, but something just isn't quite there when comparing side by side. It also doesn't get all that bright, but I suppose that's expected from the LED tech being used. You'll need black out shades or use it only during the night. Then there's the color- it isn't great. It works, but it has a cheap color reproduction that looks kind of flat and lifeless. Dark scenes sort of all blend together and become nearly impossible to see. It lacks the vibrancy of even an inexpensive television from decades ago. It gets the job done, but hardly the ""theater experience"" if you've been waiting to see that latest action/vfx film the way it was intended. It will look better on your TV at home, the only thing this has going for it is the large projection experience. For example, if you just want to give your kids a backyard movie night and don't care that the color and detail won't be as great as your indoor system, it will do the job on the cheap. I personally would not give up my mid-range projector for this one.<br />One thing that I found particularly annoying is that rather than the optical zoom and focus dials found on usual projectors, there is only a focus and tilt dial. No zoom. That means you have to physically move the projector closer or further to get it to reach the correct size you are shooting for. That actually got in the way of using it in a couple of specific places my other projectors can be used at optimal sizes.<br />That's not to say it gets everything wrong- I DO like that it is small and light and can even be turned on it's back to aim at the ceiling. That's something my big projector can't do, due to the airflow and cable management sticking out the rear.  It also has a standard 1/4"" 20 threaded tripod mounting point, so you can place this onto a tripod and get maximum mounting freedom. That will come in handy as I've always wanted to watch a movie in bed on the ceiling. But otherwise, don't think this projector will be as good as the other mid-rangers out there. This is still very much a low end projector. You'll have to spend at least 2-3x as much to get a decent home theater style experience, and much more if you want a high end one that will handle FHD/4k to get the real deal. This is more of a specialty use item.",positive,negative
B000AOYWVE,5.0,"I recently purchased a monitor and keyboard to use at my desk. I have been using ThinkPad laptops exclusively for a few years.<br />I selected the Preferred Pro USB Keyboard. I almost went with one of the TrackPad keyboards ([[ASIN:B00C32FWJC ThinkPad Compact Bluetooth Keyboard with TrackPoint - US English]] or [[ASIN:B00F3U4TQS Lenovo ThinkPad Compact USB Keyboard with TrackPoint - US English]] ), because I love the TrackPoint. However, I needed a numeric keypad, and I didn't like the idea of having a separate one. I chose the Preferred Pro on the strength of reviews. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The keyboard is comfortable to type on. They tops of the keys are textured, and they feel nice under my fingers. The key travel feels wonderful, and I can type faster on this keyboard than on a laptop. The built-in wrist rest is also very comfortable to use. The only issue I've had with the keyboard is that I keep hitting the Windows key instead of control because I'm used to the layout being Fn-Ctrl-Win. I'm sure with time I'll stop making this minor mistake.<br /><br />Pros: Traditional key layout and spacing. 3 simple lights for Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock. Keytops are slightly textured. Great Key travel. Built-in wrist rest. Professional black, dark gray, & blue color scheme.<br />Neutral: No keys for controlling volume, brightness, etc.<br />Cons: Takes time to get used to a full-sized keyboard.",positive,positive

B08HBBF6FR,4.0,"I'm a fan of Panasonic's electronics, and have been since I first used their GH camera line for work, and the DVX prosumer cameras before that. I was excited for a chance to replace my working headphones with ones from Panasonic, however I found it interesting that the plug type was NOT MENTIONED on this listing! The last pair of headphones + mic that I ordered came with a USB plug. It worked fine on my laptop, but not on my phone or tablet, obviously. I want a regular headphone jack, as in 1/8"" or 3.5mm (whatever  you want to call it!) to be compatible with all my things, and not rely on the limitations of bluetooth.<br />I was a little bit nervous about buying this one since it doesn't say anywhere that it is, in fact, a standard TRRS headphone-jack sized plug, but I'm happy to report that it IS! And the sound quality is what I expected from Panasonic, a good value for the price. One thing to note, however, is that this requires both sides have a wire going to the plug. This is a seriously old-school design that I almost forgot existed. Modern headphones have a single point of cable that splits to the other side in the band, however this is more like earbuds in that there's a wire going to each side.<br />It's not a deal breaker, it works fine and some people may actually prefer that look, but personally I'm worried about it being another point of contact that could get snagged/rip/break/go wrong, and actually prefer the more modern single-side cable style. But this is still a great pair of traditional tried-and-true headphones!",positive,positive

B000OQUMKI,4.0,"I recently acquired a pair of Able Planet Sound Clarity (SC hereafter) headphones, just 6 days after purchasing a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 15 Noise Canceling headphones (QC15 hereafter). I got a very good deal on the Able Planet phones, which is the main reason I bought them. With both sets in hand, I have been able to do a side-by-side comparison between them. Bose is generally regarded as the Gold Standard when it comes to active noise canceling phones so this review is spun in that regard. I have not had a chance to try the Sennheiser offerings, so I cannot comment on those.<br /><br />In summary, the Able Planet phones compare reasonably well against the Bose phones, but there are some trade-offs between the two. Which set to buy depends on the personal preferences and intended uses.<br /><br />First off, the phones look very similar to one another. The general design is the same, with an over-the-ear design, soft pads and an on-off switch for noise cancellation. There are some very distinct differences, though, that are not obvious at a glance. First, the detachable cord plugs in somewhat differently, the SC having a jack that this flush with the phone and the QC15 having a jack that is inset within the base of the phone, with a molded plug. The battery compartment is also accessed differently, the SC having a sliding cover exposing 2 AAA batteries and the QC15 having a flip-up cover for a single AAA battery.<br /><br />Another visible difference is in the cord that is included with the SC phones - it has a volume control thumb wheel. The QC15 phones have simply on/off. I like being able to adjust the volume without fiddling with the source such as a computer.<br /><br />Comfort-wise, Bose has an upper hand on Able Planet. While both have an over-the-ear design which covers the ear, the SC cup is a hair smaller and as such it cannot cover the whole ear as easily as the QC15. That said, the SC phones are still comfortable and the difference is minor.<br /><br />The noise canceling aspect of the SC phones is very good but it does not compare to the QC15 headset. Standing next to a running air handler that is roughly the size of a minivan, the SC is able to wipe out a good portion of the noise to make the level comfortable. The QC15 wiped out the sound of the air handler completely, to the point that it was difficult to tell if it was even turned on.<br /><br />I was interested in the Linx Audio aspect of the SC phones and at first I was very disappointed. The high range is somewhat dampened, ""S"" sometimes sounding like ""PH"". However, the mid and low ranges are solid and are very rich, whereas Bose sounds good but has remarkably less depth. The QC15 phones are primarily noise canceling phones, and sound quality is secondary to that. The SC headset achieves a better balance of sound to noise canceling.<br /><br />Once very distinct advantage that the SC headset has is that the phones will work without power, though noise canceling does not work in that case. The QC15 requires a working battery and must be turned on to work at all.<br /><br />Right out of the box, my SC phones were defective. I contacted Able Planet, hoping I could get some advice on how to adjust them, but instead I got an RMA number. Less than 2 weeks later I had a new, working pair in my hands that work much better than the initial pair. Customer service at Able Planet is very responsive, professional and courteous. With the LIFETIME warranty on their headphones, Bose cannot answer with their 2-year warranty.<br /><br />Which pair to buy is a matter of preference and intended use. If the intended primary use is noise cancellation and comfort, Bose is the right choice. For listening to music with the ability to engage noise canceling when needed, Able Planet is a better choice. Considering the 2-year Bose warranty against an Able Planet lifetime warranty, though, is hard to ignore.<br /><br />As I use my phones for listening to music more than anything else, I use the Able Planet headset as my primary headset and I keep my Bose headset as a backup.",positive,negative

B01DFKC2SO,1.0,"My AT&T/Direct TV salesman talked me into buying this worthless overpriced junk to somehow enable voice commands for my DirectTV remote (they are about the only tv service that has a remote without it).  Didn't work.  3 IT people in the family worked on it for over 2 hours just to get it connected to the Internet.  The only instructions I found on the Internet about using it to voice control my remote basically required ""hacking"" and reprogramming the Echo.  So gave up on that and cancelled by Direct TV service to go back to my old service that had voice commands and a wonderful search engine built right into the remote.  We did get it to stream music - and it sounded like a scratchy LP. So I have to buy expensive speakers for that? I'm out of table space for all of this and hate ugly cords running everywhere.  I'll just stick a CD in my DVD player or computer and listen to the music I want to listen to.  Siri on my iPhone has a better search engine.  It seems like every device you want to connect to (and I really don't want to connect it to anything - I simply don't care) costs more money for special equipment that will work with the Echo.  Spent HOURS of research on the internet trying figure out it's vague instructions.  The only time I need a smart anything is when I'm in my car and need directions - Siri does that quite well most of the time and I don't need to buy anything else.  In my home I have two computers, my iPhone and television.  All are pretty smart and keep me well informed on news and weather.  I have enough noise in my life - I don't need a device that just adds scratchy noise.  As far as music streaming Sirius is a huge waste of money so I stopped that service and decided my hundreds of CD's and/or an MP3 player can play all the music I want to hear.  I don't need any more complications in my life and I'm sick of trying to get devices to talk to each other - and the echo is the worst example of this.",negative,negative

B01FBRZK9M,4.0,"I purchased this case for my Sennheiser HD598 headphones, but unfortunately, it is too small to accommodate them comfortably. In order to zip the case closed, it is necessary to rotate the ear piece 30-45 degrees, which I'm not comfortable with since the HD598 ear piece is fixed and not intended to rotate. For a smaller mid-sized set of headphones, the db case would work great since the case is well built. If you own a set of full size audiophile headphones, you should consider other options for a case.",positive,negative
B07M5BPG8H,4.0,"I'm really glad I got this because I can distinguish it from all the other remotes. However, even though I keep it under lamps that are on as soon as it gets dusk, it does not glow very much. It definitely glows, but it is short-lived.<br /><br />It fits firestick remotes, the latest generation, perfectly. It's a very snug fit, it doesn't slide off and matches up to the buttons perfectly. You can see all the buttons through the case so you don't have to guess what button you are pushing.<br /><br />I got this to protect from dust, pet hair, or even an accidental spill on it.<br /><br />Would I recommend this? Yes... BUT if you are buying it for the glow I would try another product. If you are buying this for protection then this is a great option!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Protects<br />Fits snug<br /><br />Cons:<br />Doesn't glow very bright and the glow is short-lived",positive,negative

B0BV6MTM1H,4.0,"I recently purchased the Bluetooth Headphones True Wireless Earbuds and I have been really impressed with their performance. These earbuds come with a sleek and stylish charging case that is easy to carry around, making it very convenient for me to use them on-the-go.<br /><br />The sound quality of these earbuds is excellent, with Bluetooth 5.3 technology and Hi-Fi stereo, I can clearly hear every note and beat of my favorite music. Additionally, the Active Noise Cancelling feature helps me to block out all unwanted noise around me, allowing me to focus on my work or relax without any distractions.<br /><br />One of the features that I really love about these earbuds is the LED power display on the charging case, which shows me the battery level of both the earbuds and the charging case. This helps me to keep track of the battery life and avoid any surprises.<br /><br />The earbuds themselves are comfortable to wear and fit securely in my ears. I can wear them for extended periods of time without any discomfort. Plus, they are compatible with iPhone, Android, and Windows devices, so I can use them with all my devices without any issues.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Bluetooth Headphones True Wireless Earbuds. They are a great value for the price and have exceeded my expectations in terms of sound quality and features. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable and high-quality pair of wireless earbuds.",positive,positive
B0B7RH345W,5.0,"... and a few of the games he plays will not rotate to portrait (word search, for example) or display differently in landscape (his simple calculator becomes scientific in landscape) *AND* his severe ASD makes him OCD about having a corded iPad. I've already had to send his brand new iPad back to Apple to replace the port (they just replaced the entire product) because he had messed it up propping it on the charging cable jutting out of the port). And because he has uncontrolled seizures, he has to have a kid proof thick foam case. When these popped up as a Suggestion... I know these apps listen but I swear I'm starting to think they read minds lol... I figured I'd give them a try. They fit!! Even with his thick, foam case. It's a little tricky to get it in, but going slowly it fits and stays in the port.<br /><br />On a side note, I've got a Fire Mini (2022) with a case on it.

B09CGM1BWH,5.0,"I like the sound of these earbuds way more than I expected: they're clean and clear through my hearing range, and I didn't even have to fiddle with the EQ settings to get there.  I also have the Liberty 2 Upgraded version, and while those are very good, these are clearly superior.<br /><br />I did use the Soundcore app to update the firmware and enable LDAC: you'll definitely want to do this before you begin using them.  Also, there are other settings on the app you might find useful.<br /><br />They are also very comfortable to wear for long periods (I use them at my desk while working), and even using LDAC (which uses a lot more power) the battery lasts as long as I've needed so far.  The case is nice and compact, and of course charges the earbuds quickly.  The only thing I would grumble about (and now I'm being very fussy) is that I have to turn the earbuds over to get them into the right position for the case.<br /><br />Another note:  Anker was offering a ""used like new"" item for a much lower price, so I decided to try them.  I'm very happy I did, since they really were just like a new product, seemed unused (probably a quick return).  All the earpiece bits were new, of course.<br /><br />Highly recommended for excellent sound and comfort at a very affordable price (new or used).",positive,positive

I do have some vision issues and thought I would take his advice and see if the HD made a difference. It does. The size is perfect for reading from my Kindle Library. The battery life is long, and the buttons are on the top so there are no accidental closures of the screen. I got a refurbed model and it is in pristine condition. I can't believe how inexpensive a powerful little tool like this tablet can be. I don't do anything fancy, but I can stream video with a nice, clear picture.

There is a lot to explore in the Sony Music Center app. How many speakers allow you to hit them in different areas so you get additional sounds out of while your favorite music is playing? The girl loved adding percussion and drum sounds to the songs. By the way, did I mention the bass? The bass is phenomenal. You can link more of the units in different colors and have even more sound, more bass and more lights. The only thing that would make this better is if they made the lights color changing in each unit. This is actually a fun speaker that is amazing.",positive,positive

B01LW4G71Y,3.0,"OK, first the pros. The price was very reasonable and knowing that it was low priced I did not expect it to perform like a $1,000 TV. Also, it was easy to set up. It was easy to pick up and place on my stand. Also, the legs were easy to attach. All I had to do was get a Phillips screwdriver and screw in four screws. Also, it looks sleek and modern. And I like having three HDMI ports which is rare for a set in this price range. It's good that it has both analogue and digital audio outputs as well.<br /><br />Now the cons. First of all, I don't like they way you have to change inputs. On my old TV all I had to do was press one button on the remote and toggle through the inputs. But on this one you have to first hit the input button on the remote, then you have to press one of the arrow keys on the remote until the input you want is highlighted, then press the OK button. That process is way too cumbersome.<br /><br />Secondly, I am not satisfied with the picture quality. Since I got it yesterday I have been trying to adjust the color settings to get the picture the way I want it but I just can't seem to get it right. What really irritates me is skin tones. Fair skinned people look like they have a bright white light shining on their face. Also, dark scenes such as at nighttime are too dark and it's hard to make out anything. Adjusting the brightness settings helps somewhat, but then when the scene changes to daytime it is much too bright so I have to turn the brightness down again.<br /><br />I am debating whether to send it back. I hate to have to try to put it back in its box and then ship it back to Amazon. I think I will wait a few days to see if I can get the picture right. I will update this review after I decide what to do.",positive,negative
B096976DBS,5.0,"I bought 2 of these around Christmas 2021. One for myself, and a friend of mine as we're both avid users of AirPods Max.<br /><br />I received the ""Version 1"" of the product, while my friend received ""Version 2.""<br /><br />So let's get into it!<br /><br />I assembled version 1 and to my distraught face, the stand was incredibly wobbly. The pole piece mostly didn't fit the screw cuttings in the metal and overall the product was incredibly dissatisfying and took forever to essentially assemble wrong (since correct assembly was impossible).<br /><br />Meanwhile, my friend raves about how great it is (he got version 2). So seeing some folks had similar issues, I contacted support. About a week later I received a very nice message back. The thing I appreciate most is this wasn't a simple PR cut and paste. This sounded like it was directly from someone who really cared.<br /><br />He took my address and promised to ship out a replacement with Version 2 immediately. Not only that, he actually explained in detail the issues I had experienced and how they had fixed them with Version 2. He even went as far as to confirming version 2 was shipped to my friend.<br /><br />They explained they had requested amazon remove version 1 but were rejected. So, if you receive a wobbly version 1 product (the serial number is on the top of the base stand), they ENCOURAGE you to contact them and they will happily replace it with version 2.<br /><br />So, the product was jacked, which this company admits. They're doing absolutely everything in their power to correct the issues and are a fantastic example of how you build customer trust.<br /><br />Thanks again for everything.<br /><br />Version 2 of this product is absolutely fantastic, sturdy, does not shake or move at all. The metal is very nice looking and makes for a great set piece on your desk or otherwise. As soon as you pull your headphone off, they reconnect as you're used to when pulling them out of the case. Similarly when you place them on the stand, they'll disconnect instantly.<br /><br />Great stuff and thanks!",positive,negative

B07JYFHWGX,5.0,"These Chromebooks are a weird hybrid of tablet and real laptop. They don't do everything can full laptop does, but they do more than a simple tablet. Oddly enough, there is a place for these. This is the second one we've had in the last few years.<br /><br />This one is very light and easy to grab and use in the armchair or while on the road in the passenger seat. The screen is vibrant and the colors are true when watching a movie or looking at your photos. The beauty of a Chromebook is having super easy access to everything stored in your existing Google cloud account - photos, books, passwords, contacts, email, etc. This syncs exactly like your phone and tablets do so you can switch between machines and still keep current.<br /><br />I've been pleased with the battery life on the Acer. It can go with light use and sleep mode a couple of days before needing to be charged. It has no trouble connecting to and staying connected to our WiFi even outside on the patio. I've connected my Bluetooth headphones and watched a movie with it and it works fine. I like this and find I'm grabbing it more often than I thought I would.",positive,positive
B005OB1TU0,4.0,"First for the pros: Beautiful looking, sleek, shiny and artfully designed to fit any style room. Relatively easy to install (being a non-techy person I actually followed the verbal audio instructions easily and flawlessly). The wireless woofer is an asset with no ugly wires (as my previous Panasonic system had)and amazing (loud) bass tones. The sound is amazing (which I expected from Bose). The cons: I am having a difficult time using the remote control which is supposed to act as an all-in-one device (supposedly so I can get rid of all these little dedicated remotes I have for the DVD, television, cable, etc). For whatever reason, the device sticks frequently or doesn't respond to commands and I end up reverting back to the old standby remotes. I am disappointed that a company like Bose couldn't have perfected something like this better. But then I keep thinking, maybe I did something wrong, not sure. The only other con is the price. If this was in a $700-1000 range I would tell you to snatch it up in a heartbeat. But for $1500 you are honestly paying for the name (and the status symbol bragging rights to say you own a Bose system). Wait for the price to come down and grab it. You honestly won't be disappointed with the sound quality nor the set up (and, who knows, maybe it's me in not being able to get the remote to work properly with all my other devices).",positive,negative
B083C586HL,3.0,"It's hard to hate on this drone when it is flying. Mechanically it performs very well in the air. The camera is great & the camera stabilization works very well. The app has been a frustrating experience that has kept me from fully exploring the capabilities of the drone.<br /><br />After the last app & firmware update we have experienced freezing of the video feed, disconnects from the phone & disconnects from the radio. The good news is that, in the last case, the drone dutifully returned to its starting spot. I didn't have those issues before the update but I did have others.<br /><br />I have put in a couple of tech requests & their support is very good. In some cases a confirmation email the same or next day & resolution in another day or so. In one case a very nice young man called me to talk me through a gyro calibration.<br /><br />We have enjoyed using the camera to fly it around the neighborhood. The camera function is fantastic. The attitude adjustment for the camera is intuitive & handy. I'm still learning to fly by the screen so I like being able to ""look"" up & down to make sure I'm not about to hit something and figure out the location by looking at landmarks & streets.<br /><br />On the drone platform, the camera can be set to track a person with just the camera & the drone stationary or have the drone follow the person while tracking. We used that to record my daughter's color guard practice. It also has a ""point of interest"" feature where it flies circles over a particular spot & the operator can start or stop recording while it it is circling. I'm thinking this will be cool for parties this Summer when we can finally have people over again. For now I have is top quality shots of the top of my camper & green pool.<br /><br />It camera mode it performs very well as a stable, tracking camera. The camera gimble has a lot of range to track a person moving about & the tracking works well. If the person moves out of the frame it will not re-aquire them though in my experience. The camera can be mounted on a tripod or used as a hand-held ""camcorder"". On a tripod, it kind of hangs off to the side & down so it will interfere with some tripod setups. It is also a bit bulky to use as a camcorder but the stabilization is so good I forgive that. In either configuration a phone has to be used to stop & start recording or take pictures which I do not like & I hope they put out a bluetooth button for that.<br /><br />The controller is small compared to the ones I used for model airplanes & it is easy to hold. There is no attachment point for a lanyard. The phone is held on a mount that extends out & up & puts the phone in a good place to see but puts a lot of weight up high. The gimbles have a rubber gasket around that makes them water resistant & doesn't interfere with their operation. The controller charges with a mini-usb (ugh) & connects to the phone with included USBC or Lightning cables. The cord going to the phone could be a little more tidy.<br /><br />The case is nice, thick foam & will hold everything needed to fly except maybe a second battery. It's sturdy enough to put in checked luggage (with the batteries removed of course).<br /><br />The beginner mode is seriously slow & a good way to get used to flying especially for someone who is learning nose-in hovering & other basics. It also makes a very stable camera platform.<br /><br />A couple of observations:<br />I am not great at sorting out things on the app & would prefer robust instructions. I had no idea that the aforementioned gyro calibration was something I could perform myself or that I should have known where to look for it. It took me several tries to figure out how to turn on the tracking features (it has to be ""started"" after turning it on).<br /><br />This is my first serious drone so I can't adequately compare it to other models. I used to fly model airplanes & helicopters decades ago & I tend to try to fly these quadrotors like an airplane in line of sight flight. This model seems to resist that more than others that I have flown & tries to force a flat plane rather than let me bank it & swoop around (I hope that makes sense).<br /><br />I worked in a hobby shop for several years when I was younger (a long time ago). This is exactly what people who came in dreamed of buying; a small, aircraft that could fly in the backyard or far away that doesn't require a steep learning curve to fly or maintain. The camera adds to the fun & makes it useful.",positive,positive

B09KXF8TDQ,3.0,"Bone conduction headphones have become quite popular and because of this, there are many to choose from.  This specific model is quite minimalist.  A thin metal frame with the vibration units and electronics hanging off it.<br /><br />In terms of comfort, there is no adjustability to the metal frame so it may take some getting used to because the frame may feel like they are too big or too small depending on your head size.  For me it felt a little bit loose but I came to realize that it actually stayed where you place it and it really wasn't a problem.<br /><br />For sound quality, this bone conduction headphone will never match a nice pair of over-ear headphones but that really isn't what it's for.  By leaving the ears open, one is still able to stay aware of the surroundings, making it great for cycling and jogging where hearing the traffic is essential for safety reasons.<br /><br />A pair of earplugs are included with this product and with one or both in, one can really appreciate the difference between regular headphones and bone conduction.  You can still hear the music (or in my case, audiobook) through the earplugs because of the bone vibration but all outside sound is cut off.  This means that you'd be able to listen to music over the sound of a loud machine.<br /><br />I have tried a few different pairs of bone conduction headphones and these are the ones that I have stuck with so far.

The buttons for sound are perfect, they depress smoothly and function the changing of the volume 100% of the time.<br /><br />The covers for the charger, headphones and volume are difficult to open though. While I do appreciate the fact they are great to offer resistance to water and dust, etc. I do feel they could be a bit easier to open. They feel quite stiff and can be difficult to open (perhaps the tabs can be 'improved'). Another and more serious gripe I have is the inability to reach the vibrate/silent switch when it's cover is open. I have a very hard time reaching in there to toggle the switch because the cutout is too small.<br /><br />The sound quality is good and I have no complaints there.<br /><br />My phone has survived two nasty drops without a scratch.<br /><br />If you want a case that offers top notch protection and looks great too - look no further!",positive,positive
B085R7TPCR,5.0,"I love music, so when I got PC headphones to help me block out background noise and do my work, I wanted to be sure they would be great for music.  The active noise canceling is a great feature, it works well.  The sound quality is as good as other pairs that I have owned in the same price range.

With this in place, they make a nicely damped thumping sound.<br /><br />I'm happy.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just thought of something.  This latest (2016/2017/2018) MacBook Pro generation has a reputation for unreliable keywords.  In fact, Apple just announced an extended warranty.  What actually happens is that tiny bits of debris get into the key mechanisms, which are exquisitely engineered and miniaturized... to the point that small pieces of dust can cause the keys to malfunction.  This keyboard cover should really help that!",positive,positive

I’m profoundly hearing impaired (90%) and this speaker system is the answer to my prayers and dreams!<br /><br />I have it connected to my HGTV with an RCA adapter and my headphones are connected to the headphone jack on the side of the left satellite speaker. I have to keep my TV speakers set permanently off and only watch TV with headphones.

Unfortunately the overhead light in our downstairs room, which we use as a library, doesn't work because there's the bottom half of a lightbulb stuck in it.

I plugged this smart plug in, fiddled with the Alexa app, scanned the included QR code, and voila, I had the plug working. Not using it for anything complicated yet, like routines; I just classified it as a light. Then took it downstairs, plugged the lamp into it, and said to the Echo Dot, ""[name], turn on the lights."" And there is light. ""[name], turn off the lights"" reverses it.<br /><br />I need to figure out how to make the lights go on and off when I say ""Lumos"" and ""Nox,"" but for now it's great.

B000FJEYZS,1.0,"I can't believe I fell for buying these expensive as hell headphones, all of the positive reviewers must not have ever made a trip to Walmart to buy headphones with rubber fittings for like $15. These headphones suck for the following reasons:<br /><br />*Fit - what they do is force themselves against the upper portion of the ear which after a few minutes becomes extremely painful. The cord is longer on one side on purpose, BY A LOT so you have that wire hanging in your mouth/face the whole time due to the cord been coiled. I prefer to have cord hanging straight down and out of my face.<br /><br />*Sound - no base like you would get from headphones that fit into your ear, I did not realize how much it sounds better when the headphones go inside your ear instead of been outside.<br /><br />*Cost - you are paying only for the looks and packaging.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />I will keep the clipper that came with them, it is a very nice clipper and I will use it on my $10 set of headphones I been using at the gym.

B00RCSU0WQ,4.0,"[[VIDEOID:d6b7a8b9b0393d04acea3ab55126063e]] I love the huge selection of musical chimes. Everything from classical music, whimsy, holiday tunes, doorbell chimes, etc. I believe there are 36 options and I enjoyed running through all of them until I made my selection.<br /><br />The doorbell works great, but Inserting the transmitter battery is nearly impossible. It took three people almost a half an hour to pry the battery cover off.  Inserting the batteries into the receiver was pretty standard and I am not sure why they made the transmitter so difficult and user-unfriendly. They have included a pry-off tool just for that purpose. Hopefully, I will not need to change that battery for a very long time.<br /><br />This kit arrived with mounting hardware and double stick tape plus a single 3032 coin battery for the transmitter along with a pry tool to remove the battery cover. The dual AA batteries for the receiver are not included.<br /><br />I have the receiver standing on my desk and I am happy that ""stand-alone"" it is an option. This kit came with mounting hardware as well, but I like the idea of being able to move the receiver to whatever area I happen to be working in since I listen to loud music at work and may not hear it upstairs.<br /><br />I paid $12.99 at the time of review and you cannot beat that! Had it not been so difficult to insert the transmitter battery I would have rated this doorbell 5 stars. It works well and I recommend it.",positive,positive
B002SNB9XO,5.0,"I received this as a review sample. I am not going to repeat the product description, but do want to point out that this is designed for counters with outlets near the work surface. I mention this because although the specs clearly state that the cable is two feet long, some folks may miss that.<br /><br />This is basic protection. It is more of a breaker than a true surge protector, although the response time is one nanosecond. That's impressive. The clamping voltage, on the other hand is 600 volts, which is reason enough for me to use this on less than valuable gear like inexpensive power tools or lighting.<br /><br />Since this is priced at eight bucks (at the time of this review), it has a basic price tag, so it's a decent deal for what it is. And basically, that is a power strip with integrated protection that amounts to a circuit breaker. Better than just a six outlet strip, which costs about the same. One thing that you need to also take into account is the fact that this does not have 'wall wart' spacing. As long as you are using two or three prong power cords it's fine. If you are using any type of transformer you are going to lose an outlet or two for each of those.<br /><br />For what this is it's a decent deal as long as you understand its limitations. I am happy with mine, but I am using it on a workbench with low power and low cost appliances and tools.",positive,positive
B00WTBC1NW,5.0,"I received this as a free review sample. I'll spare you a regurgitation of the product specs or paraphrasing the previous two reviews, but will focus on what sets this one apart from the pack.<br /><br />The biggest surprise I had was volume. This is a relatively small speaker and most bluetooth speakers in this one's size and price range are designed as personal speakers that are meant to be nearby on a desk, night stand or counter top. I can clearly hear this one two rooms away indoors and even outdoors in areas with high ambient noise this can cut through and project sound.<br /><br />Sound quality is neutral, and I mean that in a good way. While there is some bias towards the mid range frequencies it does not 'color' the sound of music being streamed to it. To be honest, this is not going to crank out heavy bass, so if you listen to bass-centric music you may be disappointed. On the other hand, the highs and lows are practically seamless, with a slight emphasis towards the mid range, so if you listen to jazz, blues or some forms of rock and Americana this speaker will probably please you.<br /><br />One review discussed bluetooth range issues so I specifically tested that. Even two rooms away, which normally causes drops in quality, I was able to get crystal clear streaming with no drops in the music quality streamed from a Samsung Note 3. The distance is approximately twenty feet, but definitely not line of sight, so I am happy with that aspect.<br /><br />While the product specs claim six hours of music, you can realistically expect somewhere between four and four and a half hours if you have the volume cranked. If you drop it to about a quarter - perfect for near listening up to two or three meters - you will get the claimed play time.",positive,positive

I had planned to go smaller than 46'' but in the end I chose this TV because of the stellar reviews and the incredible feature list.<br /><br />The TV came packaged well and setup was a breeze. I'm not using the stand that came with the tv, it is mounted on a floor stand so I can not speak to the previous comments having to do with the ""creakiness"" of the stand.  The tv is amazingly beautiful. It has clean lines and a very minimalist look. I have always been impressed with sony's aesthetic qualities and this is no exception.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this with the 3d bundle and ps3 even though I currently already own one. I have been watching 3d content and also playing Gran Turismo 5 in 3d.  It's very addicting and I can see myself spending way too much time lying in bed watching movies with my dorky 3d glasses on :)<br /><br />I have since ordered the sony ht-ct150 to accompany this set and provide more depth to the sound stage. The speakers on the tv as suspected aren't really great, but I didn't buy the tv for that reason. I bought the tv for the incredible picture, the gorgeous design and the amazing reputation that sony is known for. And for all those requirements this TV does not disappoint.",positive,positive

The buttons are too stiff and she would never be able to figure out the menu. I am a pretty tech-savvy person and I am having a very hard time with the menu navigation myself. Not sure the unit is working right because it seems to constantly run into dead ends in the navigation. Either it isn't working right, or the controls are not applicable consistently.<br />At the very least, there should be some pretty comprehensive instructions with the unit.

B01ER4AJWI,5.0,"Being a Mac user for decades, it has been some time since I've had the opportunity to use a Windows based computer, so I was eager to try the Windows 10 operating system on this convertible notebook computer, also a first for me.  The Acer Aspire R 14 R5-471T-79YN has far exceeded my expectations in form and function, despite the learning curve I'm experiencing.  I won't get into the Windows 10 system, but will say that I can definitely see the influence of the Mac operating systems on its development and I am impressed.  Perhaps I like it more than many users might simply because I can't even remember the last Windows system I used being that even my remote work situations tend to not use these computers now.<br /><br />The Acer is not as lightweight as a tablet, of course, but it's also not the weightiest notebook of this size, and the brushed metal texture of the case is appealing.  It looks sleek and feels good when the computer is used. I find the keyboard to be very comfortable, the touchpad is positioned well and the silver edging surrounding it is a nice contrast.  I do not like the position of the power button which is directly beneath the power plug, as I find that  if plugged in, I have to fiddle with it to turn on the computer.  The USB ports, HDMI port, SD card reader and volume control are all easily accessible and have functioned well so far in every case I've used them this week.  The speakers are a little odd, but that makes sense since the convertible form of this means that when used as a tablet ,the rear speakers will face the area between the folded computer.  To my surprise, I find that the sound improves in tablet form, better than when used in laptop or tented configurations.  I have mine set to ask if I want to switch to tablet layout because I found that it did not always respond appropriately when set to automatic conversion.  The true HD makes this a very nice system on which to watch videos and with external headphones or speaker, either cabled or Bluetooth, it becomes a great system.  I would actually consider this one to be best suited for entertainment, and would imagine that it is excellent for games although I have not used it for that purpose at all.  The touch screen is very responsive, but it does take some time to get accustomed to the responsiveness.  The computer is very fast, very quiet, very cool (temperature), and it starts quickly.  I rather like the lack of an optical drive because that keeps it quieter and lighter, yet allows me to add a peripheral drive if I want or when it is needed.  I rather enjoyed streaming a movie from my Amazon Prime directly to a non-smart TV.  I've used this in the kitchen in both the tablet and tent configurations using the Kindle app and much appreciated having a larger screen than when using my Kindle Fire for recipe following.<br /><br />For the price, I think this is a great convertible computer which comes with a single year warranty.  I intend to give this Aspire a workout and hope that I never need to discover how the Acer warranty service performs.",positive,positive
B00BWH7TJ0,5.0,"I've tried a couple of high quality headphones and earphones lately, and have to say that these are probably the best. The sound quality is exceptional, for pc, iPhone and mp3 player listening, providing clarity and definition of both bass and tremble. It was easy to pick up elements to the song that other - lesser quality - earphones left out, and the Munitio earphones were comfortable to use (in part thanks to the three different sizes of earbuds that they provide to ensure the best fit).<br /><br />The microphone and the control buttons work well with any Apple products, which is nice (one day it'll be great to come across a universal product), and the design is appealing with the thick, flat cord (which isn't entirely tangle-free but less likely to knot up like some other earphones I've come across, especially those which are fabric wrapped) and the bronze accents. Munitio provides a nice, flat bag to carry your earphones in which can be easily tucked into a pocket or bag.<br /><br />There are probably higher end earphones that provide just as good if not better listening quality, but for the price, I'd have to recommend these.",positive,positive

They are siamesed together, but ou can easily separate them if you need two separate cables to run to separate speakers (if you use them in that way.) Or you can leave them as are to keep your cable runs cleaner.

B000V1MLBE,2.0,"A friend of mine bought one of these to take video of his kids.  I tried it.  It works fine for what it is and takes decent video, and I can see why people may not want a full-blown camcorder, but in the market today it makes no sense.  Do yourself a favor and just buy a plain old digital camera instead because almost every cheap digital camera can do what a Flip does except better and sometimes for less money too.<br /><br />Take for example the Canon SD750, which does everything the Flip does and much more for just around $30 extra plus a few bucks for a larger memory card.  It takes good VGA video exactly like a Flip, plays it back on a 3-inch color screen with sound (four times larger than the Flip's 1.5-inch screen) in four different speeds of slow-motion if you want, has a real 3X optical zoom and a 4X digital zoom (Flip is 2X digital zoom only), uses SD memory cards that can easily and cheaply be upgraded and changed (with Flip you're limited to 2GB only and then you have to offload, while a 8GB card costs around $12), and like the Flip it can also play back video directly from the camera through a TV.<br /><br />BUT you can also record video in different resolutions, with effects such as B&W and sepia tones, at different frame rates from 15fps to high-speed 60fps, either in full automatic exposure or with manual tweaks to things like white balance, with stop shutter action where the camera will take one frame every one or two seconds and then play it back as a video, etc.  Or you can just leave it in full auto mode in which case it takes less than three seconds from the time you turn it on to the time you start recording.  It gets along with Windows just fine without any software all (it comes with software but you don't have to use it).  And of course it takes fabulous 7.1 megapixel regular pictures with an enormous number of features.<br /><br />I use the Canon SD750 as an example only because I'm familiar with it.  But almost any digital camera will do what the Flip does and more, and many of them will do it for the same price or even less.  So to me at least it makes no sense to get a Flip unless you're willing to spend more money for simplicity or only want it for the cute factor.",negative,negative

B0829MM1JX,4.0,"I work in video production and sometimes need to record narration for my work. I have an expensive Rode mic system that I use with my cameras, but I decided to see how a permanent mic setup like this would do. First of all, the amount of equipment you get for the money is insane. The pop guard and arm are pretty awesome, but it turns out my desk didn't have a good place to clamp an articulating arm like that. Thankfully, it also came with a little tripod base so you can have it sit on the desk instead. The USB sound system uses a standard RealTek Audio chip, so it's pretty universally compatible and offers excellent sound quality. In the past sometimes the PC's audio input 3.5mm jack produced extra noise on account of the PSU creating some sort of line humming. With a USB audio interface, that's a non-issue.  I'm impressed with the response of it, it managed to pick up my voice and not a lot of background noise (my computer fan can get loud sometimes!). The only hangup is that I spend some time trying to figure out how to get it accessible to my recording applications. For some reason it kept complaining that the sample rate of the mic didn't match. It did, but the computer kept complaining. I ended up going into Windows sound settings, changing the sample rate, then going back in and changing it back and THEN it worked. It's been good ever since. So, still an excellent mic with impressive quality for the price!",positive,positive

Sure, you're not going to get the same audio quality as a $60 pair of earbuds, but these sound very good, not overly tinn-y and with a good bass. If I lose this pair, I will buy another just like it. I'm quite pleased with it.<br />Also love that it comes with multiple sizes of earbud attachments, as I have small ears.",positive,positive

B0079T724W,5.0,"I don't think I asked a lot in a iPad cover, but I'm impressed how well this cover has delivered.  Mostly I was looking for functional protection and a look that classy looks. This cover delivered both in spades.<br /><br />Protection:<br /><br />I love the way the iPad is held in place by the four rubber corner holder.  The case makes contact with the iPad in the most minimal way and does not allow grit to get between the case and the ipad to scratch surfaces.  I have never had the iPad slip out of these feet either, it is very snugly held in place.<br /><br />The outside materials are rugged and there are 3/16th inches of touch material between the iPad and the harsh world.  It will not protect it in a long fall, but it is safe from scratches and smudges.<br /><br />Looks:<br /><br />I was originally looking for a leather case for looks, but this is just as classy as the leather cases I have found for twice the price.  I like the leatherlike surface and the black with white stitching is subtly striking.  I even like the Belkin logo, it's a cute representation of the human form.<br /><br />Functionality:<br /><br />The magnet is well placed to hold the case closed, then when open, it holds the front flap securely attached to the back of the iPad.  Magnet strength seems to be strong enough to be functional.  Also well designed are the multiple positions the case folds into.  It has a great adjustable angle fold for watching movies and using my bluetooth keyboard.<br /><br />I don't use the camera ever, but this case does have a strategically placed hole so it is available.<br /><br />Failings:<br /><br />In general this is a great case.  The two things I can think of for constructive criticism are the inside materials and the fact that the magnet causes the iPad to wake in transit.  For the inside material, it is a velvety black material that picks up dust. Not a huge thing, but noticeable.  As for the magnet, I guess this is not uncommon, but I do completely power down the iPad if I am putting it in my laptop bag.  Otherwise it occassionally turns on and runs down the battery.  Again not a bad thing and not an issue in general.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />All in all, I love this case. It's classy and functional.  Recommend.",positive,positive

B010OYASRG,1.0,"I needed a small blue tooth speaker because the Echo Dot sound quality just wasn't cutting it and i would like to add music to whatever room I am working in that may not have a device. I have an Echo Dot 2nd and 3rd gen. The 2nd gen is tinny and the 3rd way too bass centric and boomy, but still better than this speaker. The sound quality doesn't blow me away, in fact, it is pretty bad. Not enough bass and not much of an improvement over my Echo Dot Mini 2nd Gen. Wow, this is so disappointing. The speaker paired easily with my phone and laptop, but had an issue pairing with the Alexa app via blue tooth. The controls are a pain to see in low light. As long as you keep your expectations super low you will be happy.<br />----Update-----<br />Lost another star after buying the Doss Touch speaker for $4 more. The Doss has MUCH better sound quality and paired to Echo Dot instantly. The Oontz seems to be having difficulties with Alexa. Probably going to return this and buy the upgraded version of the Doss 20W because I am much more impressed with that speaker as a whole. The sound quality on the Doss is more balanced and it has True Wireless Stereo so both can be used simultaneously. At first it was about being an upgrade to the Echo Dot sound quality, but now it's about better sound with every device. I was never happy with the sound on the Oontz to begin with and now it's completely unacceptable after trying a much better speaker within the same price range.",negative,negative

B07Q1DKVYR,4.0,"I have worked with GPS navigators from several manufacturers, including Garmin, Magellan and TomTom. Each unit has its strengths and weaknesses. My favorite GPS unit up this point has been another TomTom, an old Start 40 which served me well for several years. I was interested to see how much the series has changed since I got that older model. It has changed quite a bit – more than I expected. I like this navigator, though I can see a few things I’d change.<br /><br />First off, I have the 6” model which is a beast. I am used to a 5” GPS which I have been using, and it took some time to adjust to the larger screen. This is not to say it bothers me; it just is enough of a difference to require getting used to it. If you are upsizing like that, be aware that it takes up more physical space and placing on the windshield might require replanning.<br /><br />Out of the box, I powered it on, connected it to my WiFi network and downloaded over 6GB of updates. That’s a huge update. The map it holds is obviously the largest component to be updated, and it covers all of the US, Canada and Mexico. While it is nice to have all that coverage, I personally do not need that much map and would have liked the option of only having the US map on-board. That would cut memory requirements. My older model was limited in memory and the map grew until it could no longer fit; I can see the potential for that happening again.<br /><br />For navigation, up to this point I have stuck with the default settings, except with the 2D/3D map setting.<br /><br />My first trip with this unit was to work. I did not use it to navigate, I only used to to show the map as I drove. It found my fix quickly (one of the reasons I like TomTom navigators) and when I was driving it updated the map smoothly and quickly as I reached new features. It displayed road names, it showed the placement of certain POIs like gas stations, and because I was driving at sunrise the map switched from night mode to daytime so I got to see both maps.<br /><br />I’ll state for the record, I am not fan of the daytime map’s default color scheme. I almost always use the 2D map, not the 3D one, and it uses a set of pastel colors that might be somewhat soothing on the eyes but they’re quite drab. I’d rather see a bolder map that makes features stand out more. Another thing this unit does not show is road symbols like the interstate shield, instead opting for just small-print words. I can live with that but I do prefer the symbols.<br /><br />On the way home from work, I used the unit again, but this time to guide me on an alternate route. Friday afternoon traffic in this area is typically awful, and the route home is almost always snarled by at least one accident (sometimes as many as 4-5). I chose to follow a route I knew would take two hours to get home, though it moves the whole time. I loaded the first point into the GPS and it dutifully guided me there, taking me on a fairly optimal route. When I got there, I then told it to take me home and I was quite surprised – every other GPS unit I have used has tried to make me take a U-turn to go back the way I came to get back on the interstate (the source of the problem), but this one did not, instead taking me on a route that would connect me back to the interstate about 20 miles south. Knowing this was also a bad route traffic-wise, I made a planned turn in the middle of the route, skipping another 20 miles of interstate. Instead of insisting I turn around, the unit again adjusted my route and took me on almost the exact route I had planned to take anyway.<br /><br />What impressed me is how quickly the unit rerouted me without trying to put me back on the original route it chose. This is quite different from most units. Normally I get “turn around when possible” or “recalculating” over and over – not this time.<br /><br />I finally did let it put me on the interstate, about 5 miles from home. When I reached my exit is showed very clearly what lane it wanted me to use, and it was very obvious when I was to turn.<br /><br />I use the American female voice that reads street names. She enunciates very clearly and is easy to understand. Many GPS units sound tinny or have a buzz when the voice is active, but this one does not. My old Start 40 sounded clear too and did not buzz. I think perhaps TomTom does a better job with designing their units for sound.<br /><br />One thing I use my GPS for is speed tracking. When in an area where there are no posted speed limit signs, it is nice when the GPS shows the speed limit and your current speed. For this one, though, the speed display is very small. It’s out of the way which is good, but I’d prefer a larger display or at least some ability to make it bigger. If there is a setting for that I have not uncovered it yet.<br /><br />My primary complaint with this GPS is actually the menu system, which I find to be very clunky and odd. I don’t like it, and preferred the older menu system. It is workable, regardless.<br /><br />Most GPS units that offered traffic do so through a special antenna or attachment in the power connector. Rather than offer this, this unit instead gets traffic updates via your phone through a Bluetooth connection. This is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it does not require that the unit be plugged in all the time and it becomes much more portable. On the other hand, it means that it pulls data and if you’re in an area where there is no data connectivity your updates aren’t available. I’m still deciding if I like this arrangement or not.<br /><br />This is a good GPS with a little room for improvement in a few areas. The screen real estate is nice, and it navigates very well (better than most others I have used). It enunciates clearly and updates en route smoothly and quickly. The menu system is a little clunky, and there are some display settings I think could be better. Overall, though, this unit gets the important things right. It’s a good unit at a competitive price.",positive,negative

B09NRLX67W,3.0,"Having recently dug my music collection (odd how we go back into hobbies after years of stagnation), I took time to curate my setup (and by setup I mean my Note8 with a USB DAC) for optimal listening. Until recently, but ""best"" headphones were my Shure Aonic 4, which are excellent for the price range. The cable it comes with is okay, but preferably replaceable. It comes with an inline mic and makes a lot of feedback-noise when moved. I know cables are a mixed bag when it comes to audio equipment, so I shied away for years. But rather than place the emphasis on audio-quality improvement when looking at cables, I realized I'd rather get a cable if it looks and feels good. This one fit the ticket.<br /><br />This is the only cable I have that's meant to be swapped with MMCX in-ear headphones. They pair well with the Aonic 4. First, I'll get the problems I have out of the way.<br /><br />Since this cable is meant to connect with around-the-ear IEMs, there's a plastic wrap near each MMCX adapter. It makes wearing around the ears easier, but putting them on initially takes a few tries. They are easy to tangle, even if I use the ""roadie wrap."" Putting them on while on the go proved to be suboptimal; I have to be sitting or standing to put them on.<br /><br />Sometimes I get some feedback noise, but rarely. Definitely not the same as the stock cable that comes with the Aonic 4.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have is that the end connection disconnects nearly every time I use the cable. Having a modular cable is awesome, but the connection from the cable to the audio jack doesn't lock. I expected there to be a click, indicating it's on and snug, but no such thing. Since I use this cable while on the go, it's connected to my phone, which rests in my pocket. At least once the cable end will come loose. It's easy to press back in (just a little nudge will do), but it is rather annoying.<br /><br />Now for the good.<br /><br />The cable feels awesome. I get now why people prefer to upgrade certain cables. I care very little for how much the audio quality is ""improved"" (there's too much immeasurable subjectivity in that area), but having a cable that doesn't tangle easily and is very light makes enough of a difference to justify the upgrade. The cable is soft to the touch, though I don't doubt its ruggedness in the long term. The MMCX connectors snap satisfactorily into the Shure IEMs; at least those haven't come loose. The metal ends and Y-splitter are very nice and definitely attribute the cable with a premium look.<br /><br />This cable has sold me on the reasons to upgrade headphone cables.",positive,negative

B00488G6P8,5.0,"This SanDisk memory card was valuable with my SensaClip MP3 Player.  By adding the 8GB of music, the player has two locations to find music. Internal and external.

So, for example, I had two SensaClip MP3 Players, and one got damaged in the washing machine.  Dah!!! Tell me about it. Baddah bing, baddah bong!!!  Ok, I tried to take out the memory card, and put into my second player.  Wow, all the songs were still there.

B00ACC0P0Q,4.0,"My last several keyboards and mice have been Logitech products, specifically the Wave keyboard and mouse combination. After one of our keyboards met an unfortunate demise I bought this combo set and so far have been very pleased. I have found a couple of things about the keyboard that are less than ideal but so far there have been no major issues.<br /><br />I will talk about the mouse and keyboard separately.<br /><br />The mouse is an M705 Marathon mouse. This seems to be the mouse model that comes in many of the Logitceh combo packs and it is a good, all-purpose mouse that seems to hold up very well (this is actually the second one we have in the house now). Though by appearance alone it appears to be a little on the small side, it is actually a comfortable mouse for people with larger hands like myself. It's a five-button mouse with probably the best scroll wheel available on a mouse. Using this mouse, working with Windows 8 on a non-touchcreen device like a laptop is actually not too bad.<br /><br />The range on the mouse it good, I have been able to use it on the computer from across the room (approximately 20 feet), which makes it very suitable for use on presentations or working in an environment where multiple systems are in use and space is somewhat a limited.<br /><br />The keyboard is the very first solar powered keyboard I have ever seen or used. It is a full-sized keyboard with a full set of keys, but running across the top of the keyboard are two banks of silicon solar cells that gather light. They don't take up a lot of space and they're not unattractive.<br /><br />According to the documentation, the solar cells charge an internal backup battery that can hold a charge for up to three months so this keyboard is not slaved to brightly lit areas 24/7. There is a downloadable software application that gives a health report on the battery and the light level that actually is very interesting even though it's a straightforward and simple application. It's fun to load the application and then move a light source closer to and farther from the solar cells to see the meter change.<br /><br />The keyboard required a bit of adjustment for me. It has the chicklet style of keys, not the raised square block buttons that most other add-on keyboards have so it has a completely different profile than a standard keyboard. If you don't mind the keyboard that comes on a laptop, then this one won't be an issue either, but if you prefer a raised-button keyboard then this might not be the keyboard for you.<br /><br />Many keyboards have separate physical keys for special functions such as launching a calculator, email or working with audio. This keyboard does not and instead relies on a function key and F1-F12 key combinations. That's fine, but if you're used to having separate keys for accessing these things, there is an adjustment to be made.<br /><br />There is one primary negative that I have found with this particular keyboard. The tilt legs are very small and flimsy so I think it's a matter of time before they break off. Be gentle with this keyboard if you use the tilt legs.<br /><br />I do like the unifying USB receiver. Logitech has moved to such for most (if not all) of their product line and it definitely cuts down on the number of physical USB devices plugged in to the computer or hub. Attaching new devices is painless so it's possible to run multiple devices from the one receiver (I think the limit is 8 separate devices).<br /><br />Overall, I like this mouse/keyboard combo. The mouse is excellent and the keyboard is also good. While I think the tilt legs are the weakest link when it comes to the keyboard I do not regard that as a deal breaker though it does mean that a little caution is required when working with it. My experience with this combo is good.",positive,positive

B0097CD8II,2.0,"Hi!<br /><br />I was very excited about this camera, having used the GoPro exclusively until now.<br /><br />However, I have to say that I was extremely disappointed with the camera, the website support, the smartphone apps, and the PC software.<br /><br />I found the camera manual extremely short on important info, such as what I could and could not do while the camera was attached to my computer via the USB cable.  There are no instructions anywhere (that I could find) for using the Connect app.  I guess they figure people will just touch the screen in various places to see what happens.  I was surprised to find that I could record from the Connect app, as info online said that all I could to was ""frame"" camera shots.<br /><br />In addition, the camera itself did not work well.  The Storyteller software did download and install the latest firmware.  Here are some of the things I encountered:<br /><br />1. The camera would ""hang"" regularly, as in every time I used it.  The only way to ""reset"" was to remove and replace the battery.<br /><br />2. Bluetooth communication only worked about 50% of the time, using iPad, iPhone, and iPod.<br /><br />3. I often had to ""reset"" the camera (battery re-install) for it to be recognized using the USB connection.<br /><br />4. Record OFTEN didn't work!!  I tried to demo the camera to several people and it would not record unless I re-installed the battery.<br /><br />5. The camera often would not STOP recording!  I would slide back the record switch and the RECORD light would remain on under it and on the bottom of the camera.  Again, the only resolution was a battery re-install.<br /><br />I could find no help for ANY of these issues on the website.  I am VERY frustrated by the fact that they do not offer telephone support.<br /><br />The Storyteller software is terrible, and very lacking in support.  It is necessary to eject the camera every time its configuration is reset!  This is very frustrating when the camera was only recognized by my computer on a seemingly random basis (I tried all my USB ports and even a different cable!).<br /><br />I like many things about the Contour much better than the GoPro.  However, GoPro has the industry momentum, and if Contour wants to slow that down and gain some traction of its own, their product will need to work better and be much better supported. I think the Contour is a better camera, but the few problems I had with the GoPro were resolved quickly and easily with the information they provided.<br /><br />I hope this product gets better.  Until it - and the support - improves, I can't use it or recommend it to anyone else! :)<br /><br />hb<br /><br />UPDATE:  Received a call from Contour Tech Support. They ""schooled"" me on the fact that everything taking place in this camera requires the SD card.  There isn't even a little on-board memory.  Thus, if the SD card doesn't work exactly right, neither will the camera.  Without an SD card working perfectly, all you have is a piece of hardware!  They suggested that I format the SD card with the utility at [...] (SD Formatter), and then re-format in the camera.  I have already sent back the camera, though!",negative,negative

B00VAF8X8A,4.0,"This is a pretty good case and keyboard for the iPad mini 2, but there are a few drawbacks.  There's more positive than negative, though.<br /><br /> First, the negatives: (1) the backspace key is not in the top right corner, it's one row below. You will hit the &#34;=&#34; button way more than you want to while looking for the backspace button. (2) the apostrophe is on the L key and you have to press the Function button to use it. You will type &#34;it;s&#34; way more than you want to. (3) there are extra keys on the keyboard such as cmd, alt, option, and a weird symbol that looks like a swirly for which my iPad has no function that I am aware of.<br /><br />Now, the positives.  They keyboard is smaller than usual (of course) but pretty easy to use with a little practice. The screen tilt function is fantastic.  It can hold the tablet at an unlimited amount of angles.  The screen can spin 360 degrees so it can be used with the keyboard as a prop in a triangle format, with the keyboard in the back for movie watching, or out flat for typing in bed with the tablet propped up on your knees. I like how it makes my tablet into a mini laptop. I also love how the keyboard tucks in behind the screen for coloring or sketching with a stylus.<br /><br />The case is very sturdy, made of a rubbery feel type material, and nice to look at and touch. Not cheaply made at all. It has lights for charging, battery, and Bluetooth pairing. All the holes, speakers, and cameras are exposed where they need to be. I have a tempered glass screen protector on the iPad and it does not get in the way of the case at all.<br /><br />The keyboard does add some weight to the tablet, but this does not bother me. Overall I am very pleased with this product.",positive,positive
B074N1B15F,5.0,"I’ve owned this power bank for 2 years and it has been an exceptional and reliable source of power. I use it about once a month for a week at a time when I go RV camping to power my laptop. On its own, the laptop’s battery would only last at most 2 hours. But with the laptop plugged into the power bank, after I’ve used my laptop for 2-3 hours, the power bank charge has only dropped from 100% to as low as 77%--that extrapolates to 8-13 hours which is way more than I would usually need. So I no longer have to worry about my laptop running out of power. When I’m done, I plug the power bank into my RV’s 12V outlet and it recharges back to 100% in about 4-8 hours depending on how low its charge is.

B08QTQWGS5,5.0,"For the type of run-and-gun projects I do, if I can get away with plugging a mic directly into the camera ( often a single stereo 3.5mm jack these days) I will always prefer to do that than a dual-sound setup that needs to by synced in post. However, sometimes you need more than one mic, so what's a one-man-crew to do? Well, traditionally I would use a TRS break out cable, which essentially looks like a headphone splitter Y-cable, but splits the Left and Right channel into separate plugs instead of doubling them. That's great because I can connect one mic to Left and the other to Right, then split them up and remix in post as needed.<br />But this is much more elegant solution- It is essentially the same idea, splitting the L + R into two sides, but not only is it less messy since you don't have Y cables dangling, it also serves as a point in which to mount 2 coldshoe receivers directly to single shoe mount, essentially making this an all-in-one solution to turn a single mic input setup into a dual one.

I’m sure a lot of that has to do with the constant tugging and stretching due to the fact I sleep in these, which act as both headphones and sleep mask. Despite this, I keep buying them because I’ve yet to find any other headphones as comfortable to wear in bed.",positive,negative

B0811WQ4P8,5.0,"Then you will love this. Years ago, something similar was around and I had it. I played with it, the grandkids played with it and finally one wanted it so badly, I gave it to her. That isn't happening with this little guy. I love this. I like that it plays nice sleeping music. I like that it is an alarm clock, has smart features that you normally don't get with speakers and that it has nice sound to it. This is hands down, my favorite bluetooth speaker and will go on vacations with me. I like that I can customize the looks too. This is a conversation maker. You need to get one.",positive,positive
B00JKM077A,5.0,"This is basically a business software program.  The capabilities are quite amazing.  This is a full program, and as I said, perfect for a business company.  It appears easy to use, the interface is not confusing.  Businesses who provide forms and documents can each work on the project, with several giving input to the document.  Creating forms is another great feature!<br /><br />There are businesses who could certainly use this.....however, people do not want to learn how to use software, as it can be intimidating.<br /><br />Generally, PDF features can be easy to operate, without excessive features that one may never use.  But, this is a top of the line PDF Software Program.<br /><br />PDF….  What does it do?  PDF stands for portable document format.  What this does is transfers your regular documents into a read only document, in other words, freezing the document, so it cannot be changed by other readers.  But, fear not, you can do some editing on your PDF, but for other readers, in a Read Only format, they cannot change it.<br /><br />The best part of this,  and most intriguing feature,  is the Speak recognition.  You can add a comment to your document by speaking into the computer.  The info you spoke gets typed into the document.  HOWEVER.... I have not figured out how to make it work, and I used a headphone set.  Anyway, I will and it is a great feature!<br /><br />Redacting is another helpful tool;  as this means you can take personal info out of a document, to create a new PDF to share.  Oftentimes, in the office, if you do proofreading, as I do, you may need to compare documents.  And this is a valuable tool for publishing documents, the ability to compare one versus the other.  The steps are simple.<br /><br />Again, as I said, this offers a lot of features, not difficult to work with, impressive.....but in the long run, better for company than individual home set-up  Excellent Program!

B01NBDY6VP,4.0,"I work for the United States Postal Service and recently purchased the OontZ Angle 3 Plus Bluetooth speaker for use in my LLV truck on my rural mail route. The speaker performs beautifully and I wanted to protect it to, from and while at work so I purchased this case. I was mainly wanting a safe way to transport and store the speaker, but after reading the other reviews I was hoping I would be able to keep it clean in the case and still enjoy my music on my route. I received the case and used it at work yesterday. The case is extremely nice and I appreciate the interior mesh pocket and the carabiner clip. I have no need for them now, but I'm sure they will come in handy if I ever take this speaker on vacation and need to take the charging cables along and want to clip the case to my day pack. As for playback while in the case? Yeah, it was terribly muffled. It didn't work for me as it apparently has for others. Yet, the case itself is exactly what I was wanting for taking it to and from work. I like how smooth the zipper is and how heavy duty/reinforced the stitching for the zipper is. The interior is not as thickly padded as I would have expected, however it does protect the speaker. I deducted one star due to the mediocre interior padding. I hope that, if the company ever revamps this case design, they beef up the padding a bit.",positive,negative
B0BHNK1JLZ,5.0,[[VIDEOID:87047ac0bc13933326c9bc54d8d01baf]] These are nice looking headphones I thought.  I like the design and think they work well as noise cancelling.  You can here some thing shut it felt muted overall<br /><br />They’re nicely padded I thought.  Seems like they can fit most heads without issue.

B0006G332A,3.0,"I just started using my camera yesterday and my first impression is that this thing seems very fragile.  Hope I don't drop it, as it might not survive the fall.  It is extremely small, light and compact.  Think of two packs of cigarettes or two packs of playing cards.  It is that small.  Great for travel due to the light weight and compactness.  Got it for about $90 on sale; would hate to pay more than that for it. Very easy to operate, but if you have big hands, this will be too small for you.  Be warned that it won't take more than a couple minutes of video without a memory card, so you'll have to put a little more money into it if you really want to do video or really much of anything.  The first video I took came out pretty decent, but it was in good light.  I tried some still shots inside at night and they came out very dark in spite of the flash.  The flash doesn't seem adequate, so this is probably a camera best used outdoors or in the daytime.  Great camera for a kid.  This is a good camera for small hands and a great size for kids.  If they break it or lose it, you aren't out a bundle.  As another reviewer pointed out, it does only take video in the ASF format; not MPEG, as the advertising suggests.  I think MPEG might be just music files.  I didn't need to install the software to capture the pictures or movies on my computer (Windows XP).  Another great thing is that this is a complete package.  It has the camera, a carrying strap, a carrying case, USB cable, TV cables, headphones, battery, battery charger and software.  It does not come with a lens cap and the cap is not available either.  You can buy an optional tripod for it and with the small size, I think that could be useful in some situations to help hold and stabilize the camera.  I am not sure how you store music on it; I probably won't use that feature, but it seems like it would be a nice compact music player; again you'll need a memory card to save much of anything on it.  One problem I had so far.  The memory card (which you have to buy separately--a standard SD card) slips in the bottom under a little rubber membrane.  The first time I held the camera I accidentally popped out the card and lost the shots I was trying to take.  This might be a problem and I am thinking I may have to put a piece of heavy tape over the bottom to hold the membrane and memory chip in place and prevent ejecting the memory again.  Another downside that I see is the battery.  You can't just pick up some spare batteries at the corner store and pop them in.  You have to use the special rechargeable battery.  If you don't have a spare one charged up, your camera will go dead and you'll have to wait until you can plug in the charger and recharge the battery.  That's another $20 for a spare battery.  My digital camera uses standard AA batteries, so I can use either rechargeables or regular batteries.  If this camera used regular batteries, it would make it larger and heavier, so the small rechargeable does help on the weight and size.  Don't buy this if you are a serious photographer.  Buy it for occasional use, for easy portability and as a first camera to learn on.  Controls are easy and straightforward.  Nice camera for the money, but not for serious photographers.  It does a lot for a tiny little thing; sure doesn't make me want to go back to the days of huge video cameras that you had to hold on your shoulder, due to the weight.  Minaturization can go too far and this is about as small as I would ever want to go; might be easier to use if it was just a tiny bit bigger.",positive,negative

It has very good rich audio quality which I do use to listen to music sometimes, but I feel like have very little control regarding what sources of music it plays from and I don't like that.... Alexa will only play from designated sources and using the web browser to load stuff from other places removes the futuristic talking aspect of the device so.....

B07XQNFP4Y,4.0,"I was looking for some replacement headphones for two sets in my family when I had the opportunity to try out some of the new Carlos Santana line of headphones.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These headphones come in a great box which will appeal to fans of Carlose.  It is well decorated and presentation is done so well, it would make a great gift.  These are the black ones, and there is also another set available in white under a different listing.<br /><br />ARE THESE REAL LEATHER?<br />According to the case,t these are leather padded ear cups and the lower half of the headband.  I am still not sure about this.  It is possibly bonded leather.  Bonded leather is made from leather scraps chopped up and blended with binders.  Sheets made of this mixture are printed with leather look imprinting.  Technically it can be called leather, but it really is not leather as I define it..<br /><br />EAR CUSHIONS AND HEADBAND<br />These black headphones are comfortable.  I can wear these headphones longer than many others I have used.  My daughter who ended up with these, uses them constantly and raves about them.  These can be worn for several hours without a problem. She has sweaty ears and these are not nearly as frustrating for her as many others.<br /><br />CORD FOR CORDED LISTENING<br />This comes with a cord which is only 38 inches long.  That is a bit short for me.  I find it is annoying and not quite as long as I would prefer, but my daughter does not use it so I guess it is not a problem for her or if you are like her, you won't mind either.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE SOUND?<br />We are all surprised at how really good these sound.  The bass is well defined and clear/strong, and the mids and highs are definitely clear and not muddy.  The bass is not overwhelming either, which is a problem with some headphones.<br /><br />HEADPHONE CONTROLS<br />The controls can be a bit difficult to read, but once you know where they are, you can figure it out pretty quickly.  The +/- and play/pause buttons are separated by the noise cancellation button which is good.<br /><br />HOW ARE THESE ADJUSTABLE?<br />These adapt to all sorts of comfortable positions..  They go longer, tilt in and out and rotate from side to side.<br /><br />ARE THESE ABLE TO FOLD TO BE COMPACT?<br />These do fold flat and compact if you need to travel with them or store them in a smaller storage area.<br /><br />CASE?<br />This did not come with a case.<br /><br />SOUND CANCELLATION PERFORMANCE<br />The noise cancellation is awful.  It hardly works.  When noise cancellation is turned on, the sound gets pretty compromised.  It becomes almost muffled in a way and the base definitely goes down.<br /><br />OTHER FEATURES WITH THESE HEADPHONES<br />The ability to know how much power is left on the headphones while using the phone is nice, but it does not help if you are using these some other bluetooth device and not a phone.  During phone calls, people hear just fine and we can hear them too (several of us tried this feature with our phones)<br /><br />THE  BOTTOM LINE<br />At this price point, these headphones are a step up from what I usually get when getting headphones for this price range.  The sound is well defined and well balanced.  Compactness  for storage is great, and the comfort is also very good.  The only disappointments are noise cancellation, short cord for corded listening, and buttons being a bit difficult to read.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  With better performance from noise cancellation, these would be really really good.  As they are, they are still pretty great.  They are a great gift to yourself or someone else and are some of the nicer headphones I have used in my journey through headphones of all sorts as well as those the family has obtained.  They are not B&O or Turtle Beach, but they still are pretty good.",positive,positive
B07F62W3TQ,5.0,"First time I put these on on the plane, I thought they did an amazing job blocking the noise.  Then I realized I hadn't even turned the active noise cancellation on... wow! What a difference!<br /><br />They also work and sound great as a Bluetooth headset.  They also work great with or without being on with a wired connection.<br /><br />So you can turn it on and off, turn the noise cancellation on and off, and still use it when off with the included normal headset cable!<br /><br />Includes all the cables and if needed, older airplane plug adapter, AWESOME semi hard case.  Bought a second one.",positive,positive
B01N0KAOQN,4.0,"What really convinced me the person showing that it can be really loud outside, i was pretty disappointing. Comparing how big it is,the speakers are not upto what you pay for. Quality of sounds need alot of improvement. i would say more suitable for small room or bathroom.. i think a feature or an app to turn off the light from phone would be beneficial and a nice addition to the speaker.<br /><br />Update 2 (1/22/2018): OMG i want to leave this review at 4 star because it gets noticed often but really its 3 star now. Here is why: The playing time on this speaker is 3-4 hours, some would say its pretty good, but the size of this speaker and the price i dont find it good. Also when i am saying playing time of 3-4 hours thats with the LED lights off, now imagine cut maybe 30 min of playing time from it if you are using the LED lights. The battery life will only decrease as you recharge the speaker lamp often, so put that account if you are thinking of purchasing.<br /><br />Hope this helps",positive,negative
B01IXU9OVY,4.0,"The cord is a great length, long enough to be comfortable, but not so long I get tangled in them. They remind me of my original ipod earbuds in the respect that they do tangle,no matter what you do,they end up in knots. But, they are sturdy enough not to break. I think that is the trade off.<br />The mic work great, no issues with sound quality<br />The sound is good, especially for the price. You can crank it up with no distortion, and the bass is pretty good for ear buds.<br />I use my ipod to listen to books, mainly at night while falling asleep. These are super comfortable,I don't end up ripping one out so i can sleep on my side. No sore ears.<br />My only complaint is there is no volume control,the pause and start works great but make sure you have the volume where you want it.

B07GTQWMYQ,5.0,"My wife and I decided to upgrade our entire living theatre setup this February. We purchased this soundbar for $798 and a Vizio P759-G1 TV for $1234. The best part of this setup is that the Vizio TV and soundbar support “common mode” transport of Dolby Atmos. This means that our Apple TV 4K can be plugged into any of the five HDMI ports and this soundbar will receive (compressed) Dolby Atmos. The majority of our movie watching happens on the Apple TV 4K with iTunes movies that have Atmos soundtracks. This form of Atmos is already compressed (Dolby Digital Plus) so we aren’t really losing any quality. We love our new setup in our smallish living room. The 10” subwoofer is also a huge improvement over the 8” woofer in the Vizio SB4551-D5 soundbar we had previously. The passive radiators inside the bar also help with its musicality. There’s actually a lot of detail in the mids versus other bars. Vizio has always made very “musical” soundbars, but this one is exceptional. We moved that system to our bedroom. Now we have full surround sound in two rooms (one with full Atmos!) and we couldn’t be happier.",positive,positive

B0BHS296XZ,4.0,"The main thing I am looking for in a dock is the ability to use 2 external displays, which this does with flying colors. Specifically, I am using 1x 1440p and 1x 1080p. For it to work, you need to install a quick driver, which is simple.<br /><br />The biggest thing with this dock, it the size (get it?). It requires external power, and it comes with an AC adapter. This thing would not be easy to pack up and travel with. If you will be traveling a lot, I would recommend a more portable option.<br /><br />Other than the size, this is a great dock.

B0747LWDC1,3.0,"I have worked with a lot of Bluetooth headphones, all of which have their strengths and weaknesses. These headphones by Panasonic are on the less expensive end. The question is whether they are worth the asking price. In my opinion, they could be better and are still priced a little high.<br /><br />Comfort-wise, I do not care for these but this is a personal preference. I like a headphone that fits tightly and presses down on my head, and these are very light-fitting. They adjust well enough and there should not be too much trouble getting these to fit almost any head, but keep in mind that they’re not the type that clamps down tightly.<br /><br />The build quality is sub-par. These are very lightweight and feel quite flimsy and fragile.<br /><br />I found an issue in the sound profile. The bass is good and not too heavy, and that’s good news for me. I dislike strong bass which is good for giving me headaches. The midrange is on target too and the music has some depth. Where the problem lies is in the highs. When listening to music I noticed some distortion in the highs. It’s not in-your-face and it doesn’t ruin the listening experience unless you are really fussy about your music. These will be fine for listening to speech, though.<br /><br />I had no trouble connecting these to my laptop via Bluetooth. These come up quickly and connect without any issue and are ready to go in seconds. These aren’t the absolute fastest connecting phones I have worked with but they are among the faster ones I have used.<br /><br />There’s no protective case for these phones in the box, not even a sleeve. These do fold up nice and compactly but I am not sure what is the point without a case in which to store them.<br /><br />As I write this, the asking price for these phones is $60 which is a bit high in my eyes. If the sound profile was perfect, or if the build quality was higher, I would be more amenable to that price but the truth is that less expensive phones can be found that have a better sound profile and are constructed more solidly - and they have a case.<br /><br />These are not bad phones, but I think they leave much to be desired. The build quality is mediocre, the sound profile is imperfect and the cost is a little high for what is in the box.",positive,positive

B072JWYJMC,5.0,"I have worked with a lot of headphones, active noise canceling (ANC) phones in particular. ANC phones are interesting in that while they are good at stripping out white noise they frequently do not sound quite right because they twiddle the sound profile, usually in the bass range, to compensate for the sound frequencies they filter out. Also, there are varying levels of ANC, the standard to which others are compared is Bose. This headset by Jabra came as a huge shock to me, both for the very balanced sound profile and the aggressive ANC function.<br /><br />This headset is on-ear, not over-the-ear. Usually I am a bit wary of on-ear headphones as they tend to be a little uncomfortable. These have very soft, leather-like pads and they are actually quite nice – for a while. After about an our of wear they start to get slightly uncomfortable for me, though taking them and shifting them a little makes them fine again.<br /><br />The ANC function is VERY aggressive, approaching the same level as Bose but not quite. It is able to wipe out the sounds of the A/C, a fan, engine noise and more. Like Bose, when these are first turned on the ANC gives the wearer a sensation of pressure on the ears. Using this without feeding in noise, it is possible to enjoy relative quiet when traveling, reading, studying or enjoying similar activities.<br /><br />The sound profile is on point. The bass is present and unmistakable, but it is not pushed forward so much as to dominate the whole profile and drown out the midrange. The midrange is bright and warm, giving music the right depth instead of making it sound like it’s either in a tunnel or in a barrel. The highs are very good – solid but not piercing. Jabra has nailed the sound profile where a lot of others have screwed up.<br /><br />This is also a headset for talking, and call clarity when using with a mobile phone is very good. I have had excellent results using this headset and it has worked extremely well for me. There is a caveat, though – because this headset covers both ears, it is not suitable for use while driving in many jurisdictions. It’s great when in the office, but know your local and state laws if you plan to use it in a motor vehicle.<br /><br />There are two ways to use this headset and connect it. It has built-in Bluetooth and it pairs and connects very quickly with my phone. It also has a USB dongle for connecting to a PC, though it can be connected to the PC via Bluetooth too. My observation there is that volume levels are reduced when connecting to a PC via Bluetooth.<br /><br />The headset comes in a crush-resistant case and includes the USB dongle and a USB cable for charging.<br /><br />I can find little about which to complain with this headset. It does get slightly uncomfortable for extended wear, but it has great ANC and a very balanced sound profile. As a headset it works great for talking, too, and the Bluetooth pairing is fast. This has already become my favorite set of headphones for streaming music, though because of laws where I live I cannot use it as a hands-free set while driving.",positive,positive

B01149G0YU,5.0,"I use messenger bags as book bags to take books and tools to and from work every day. I favor canvas bags because they are tougher than nylon and they are a bit more masculine-looking. This particular messenger bag is a little more stylish than some of the others I have seen and so far I am happy with it.<br /><br />A messenger bag is characterized by the fold-over flap that snaps closed over the main compartment. This particular bag has a very colorful and decorative weave that makes up the entire flap and the result is a softer and more supple flap than if it had been made of the same canvas material as the rest of the bag. That is not a fault or imperfection by any means but needs to be mentioned as a difference. Compared to the flap, the rest of the bag is more coarse and rigid.<br /><br />Everything about this bag suggests quality. The stitching is very tight and the materials are even and there are no imperfections (nicks and cuts) that I can find on this bag. The stitching used to attach the shoulder strap to the metal loops on the bag, as well as to attach the leather trim to the canvas, is visibly thicker and stronger than what was used to hold the canvas portions of material together. I like the fact that there is some manner of reinforcement on the bottom of the bag (stitched inside so it is hard to know exactly what kind of reinforcement was used).<br /><br />Instead of actual snaps, the flap is attached to the front of the bag using magnets. These make it a lot easier to open and close the bag.<br /><br />In the main compartment of this bag are three pockets, one zippered and two smaller pockets that are open on the top. The smaller pockets are ideal for cell phones, small note pads, a calculator and the like while the larger pocket is big enough to accommodate a checkbook or a small book; it is not quite wide enough to handle a DVD case. There is a front pocket that is just barely wide enough to handle a 10” tablet (though I would put a tablet in the main compartment instead). Finally, there is a zippered pocket on the back that is slightly more narrow than the front pocket because of the zipper and is good for papers and maps.<br /><br />This is a nice messenger bag and I like it. It is made very well, it is spacious enough to handle a couple of technical books and it looks nice.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

B07H2RCWT4,4.0,"These earbuds are a little on the bulky side (at least for me), but the sound quality is decent and I like the wire that attaches the buds. I've lost the separate bluetooth earbuds multiple times but the ear phones with the wire that connects to the device gets caught on EVERYTHING so these are a Godsend! Lasts for hours and charges up quickly. They eventually do hurt my ears after wearing them for an hour or so but then you should be wearing them for that long and my ear holes are on the smaller side even with the small silicone ear attachment. Really decent and worth it to have!",positive,positive

B07TBRYDBV,2.0,These earbuds are so big and bulky. I am a woman and couldn’t stand wearing them. They hurt my ears no matter how I wore them.

B0B56L2P4Q,5.0,This small device packs a lot of technology in for barely over $20. Easy to pair via Bluetooth and transmit via the fm radio. Call reception is very good. I plugged in a USB thumb drive with flac files and the music playing on the radio sounds great. I also hooked up my Astell & Kern AK Jr via the aux input and again got very nice audio quality with the radio. Also charged my iPhone quickly. Highly recommend and lots less expensive than replacing the stereo in the car.,positive,positive

B08HGFB47M,5.0,"The video quality of this camcorder is equal to the price point, basically don’t expect the same video quality as a $2000 camcorder.  Great camcorder for the young budding videographer,  for recording birthdays, vacations, graduations, and private video recording etc. The video recording time varies depending on the video recording settings that are selected and condition of the battery.  The led lamps will be an added drain on the battery and will greatly reduce the recording time.  The led lamps NOT IR lamps for true night vision, they only add additional lighting to areas that have dim light areas that are being recorded.

B0BKG4FCT9,5.0,These really cancel out the noise quite well. I had a set of similar earbuds but one found it’s demise in the toilet (not a good day).<br />I tried to find the old pair since I liked them but no luck. These popped up as an item that was similar. I liked that the charging dock shows the battery power as my wife has a set from a different seller that doesn’t show this and it’s quite frustrating to gauge battery life.<br /><br />The standard ear plugs that came with the device worked for me but there are a couple more size options.<br /><br />The sound is great and since they snug right in your ear it’s easy to keep them in and not falling out. I don’t notice any static and have actually found they are louder than my other pair (I’ve had to adjust the volume down on my walks from my previous pair).<br /><br />Great set. They are a little hard to get out of the case but that’s the same issue all of these earbuds have since there’s not a tiny handle piece to grab hold of (just a rounded top of the earbud).<br />Great and highly recommend!,positive,positive
B083ZP6988,5.0,"Our family is a bunch of speaker and ear phone fanatics.  Everyone has different likes and I tend to like a well balanced music.  Muffled really bugs me.<br /><br /> I wanted to have a nice balanced speaker that no one will take so I decided to get this one for ME.  It has a nice solid housing and I figured it was worth getting since my favorite speaker seems to get misplaced a lot.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a very solid speaker.  It is heavy duty and it has metal housing.  The sides are not as fragile as others I have used which sound this good.  It comes in a beautiful gift box which has cushioning and the typical Santana design to it.  The speaker itself is pretty heavy so it is not something you toss in your backpack and run off with.  It needs a bit more care than that.<br /><br />CHARGING<br />This has a USB charger that will take about 4 hours to charge it up with.  There is also a connection where you can get a FAST charger from the company, but you have to contact them for it.  The charging cable comes with it just need a USB outlet.  The directions warn to only use the original cable that comes with this to charge or there might be damage to the speaker. The voltage must be 5V with current rated at 115A.<br /><br />CAN THIS RUN WHILE CHARGING?<br />I do not see in the instructions warnings against this, and it does work while plugged in.<br /><br />PLAY TIME<br />This speaker runs out of juice pretty quickly.  If you want it to last the entire time of 10 hours, I highly suggest you not put the volume up past 30%.  Any higher and the battery time runs down pretty quickly.  At 60% you are at the edge of running this down pretty quickly- as in 4 or 5 hours play time only.<br /><br />PAIRING<br />I have had no issues pairing this with tablets or phones using Android.  Just like when you turn the power on, it says PAIRING in a very loud voice so you will know when it is in pairing mode.<br /><br />VOLUME<br />The volume button on this is tricky.  If you are not thinking and just quickly press the volume once, instead of it getting slightly louder, you will skip a track.  You have to press the volume down and not let up if you want the sound to go up or down depending on the button you press meaning +/-.<br /><br />CARD SLOT<br />This speaker can also work off of a TF card (also known as a microSD card).  You just have to change from bluetooth mode to card mode using the MODE button.<br /><br />IS THERE AUX CAPABILITY?<br />I have an old MP3 player that has higher quality recordings than anything new I have. That only uses AUX and it works great with this.<br /><br />PAUSE / PLAY<br />You can pause or play music with this using the MFB button<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />Let me tell you, this thing ROCKS.  I mean it.  This speaker is fabulous.  Not only does it work great out of the box (after being fully charged) but it sounds better and better as you break it in.  It fills the house with music that is great quality and does not have interference or any lag issues either.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT BASS, MIDS AND HIGHS?<br />I have to say that this speaker is one of the few that I have used which does a beautiful job of intense bass, balanced clear highs but the mids are not muffled at all.  It is impressive and what I thought a speaker always should be.<br /><br />CAN YOU USE TWO TOGETHER?<br />This allows you to add one other speaker to the system so you can have them in two places.  I do not have another Europa speaker at the moment I can test that with.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this blows any other wireless speaker I have had out of the water, it does blow through power rather quickly unless the volume is pretty low.  It is not only amazing out of the box (After charging) but it gets better with more use.  This baby ROCKS.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Finding a speaker which does not overwhelm you with out of whack bass, piercing highs, or muffled middles is not always easy.  This speaker seems to divide it all out very well.  It is one of the nicest speakers I have used (wireless) to date.  FIVE STARS!<br /><br />Not only do I love this, but would definitely consider a second one along with the fast charger in the future to round out the whole system.<br /><br />ANOTHER THING<br />This product has a notification on it that some of the proceeds from this product will go to help underprivileged children through the MILAGRO foundation (miracle) that Carlos Santana and his family started in 1998.",positive,negative
B07GZNK328,4.0,"One more thing to stop all conversation!  Our granddaughter loves these - first of all, the color - and then the sound quality.  It was difficult to separate her from them when it was study time, but the good thing is that she likes them enough to take care of them.

B007JIN6T8,5.0,"I purchased this case based on other reviews because of the excellent keyboard (removable), and Zagg's reputation for quality products. The case offers excellent iPad protection, and the keyboard is exactly the right size and very responsive!  Very easy to set up the Bluetooth connection with the included instructions. The case is lightweight, but offers excellent protection. The only thing I would strongly suggest is adding a screen protector to your iPad. When this case is closed, the screen rests directly on the keys of the keyboard. Otherwise, this case is excellent and I will use it solely when traveling.  I highly recommend this case and keyboard for those who prefer typing on a real keyboard as opposed to the virtual keyboard. It is specifically designed for iPad with custom keys added to access various options with keystrokes (closing apps....).",positive,positive

B0038W0N8G,4.0,"This has proven to be a very nice little acquisition.  We got it primarily as a way to unlock the songs on our iPods so we could share them, or enjoy music without being tethered to headphones, but it has ended up being our bed stand iPhone charger and portable music player.<br /><br />The sound put out by these speakers has a Bose-like quality (not exactly Bose equivalent, but a similar, warm, full sound.)  This is not a particularly loud sound system, but it does fill our small bedroom adequately to a reasonable volume.  It will not fill a large room or outdoor area for sure, or belt out heavy metal, but does great at an adult contemporary listening level.<br /><br />After getting this, one thing became quickly evident.  The lack of a remote kind of sucks.  At first I figured it wouldn't be a problem, but since you must use the controls on the ipod, (the speakers only have volume and power controls built in) you need to move to the speakers to skip songs, change volume or turn off.  This doesn't seem like a big idea, and for the price, it is understandable that there is no remote, but I found that it is worth the extra money to get a speaker system with a remote.<br /><br />One thing I really like about it is the portability and the ability to run off of batteries.  We have used it a couple times at night to play owl calls to hear owls call back to us. Also, since it is so portable we move it all around the house and garage which is very handy.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Nice full sound (although not overly loud)<br />Highly portable<br />Battery power option<br />Nice and small<br />Well designed<br /><br />Cons:<br />No Remote<br />Picks up dust quickly, hard to keep clean<br />Limited controls, you must use controls on iPod<br />No equalizer controls<br /><br />All in all, it fills a niche for us and we are happy with the quality of the product an the sound.  It is all around nice set of speakers at a nice price.",positive,positive
B081ZTYVXT,4.0,"My 19 year old daughter recently inherited a car from her grandmother. There were 2 things that I had wanted her car to have - Bluetooth and a rear view camera. The 2012 Honda Civic had neither of those. This car multimedia player arrived at the right time. It wasn't too difficult to install. My husband while assisted by our daughter completed the whole thing in less than an hour. Prior to the installation, we had ordered an install kit for the car model. This unit works very well with Apple Play! It basically displays your phone on it so your phone on it. So you use the touch screen method to access your music, driving maps, etc. It comes with a microphone for phone calls. They installed it near the ignition, but the quality of calls isn't that good. The next time our daughter comes home from college, they're going to try it somewhere else. Overall, our daughter is very happy with it. It has wires specifically for a rear view camera, so guess what we're installing on her next visit?",positive,positive

B00CO07C5U,4.0,"Very satisfied with the S3821 unit.<br /><br />I purchased this at Costco's online site as it was on special for $ 30 off.  That's why it's not shown as an Amazon verified purchase.<br /><br />Overall excellent.  A few issues and one dislike.<br /><br />The digital optical cable provided  was flimsy and didn't work.<br />So- I decided to try the Coaxial cable provided.  It fit the Vizio soundbar, but not the Vizio TV.<br />Next, I went with the RCA cable, analog connection.  Disappointing sound, but still better than my TV.  Subwoofer was nearly nonexistent.<br /><br />The next morning, I found an old high quality optical cable I had in storage.  Connected immediately with noticeably higher quality sound.  Also, the subwoofer sounded a lot better after the optical cable replaced the RCA cable.<br /><br />My dislike is the led light system that you must use to find the right input.  Finding the right input by sound is certainly possible, but I kept missing the connection by not waiting enough between presses.  Look at the instructions provided.  For optical cable, it's the lights out preceding the 4 lights to the right.  Wish they just had a few lights with marked inputs.<br /><br />Every time you go to bluetooth, the input automatically changes to the correct input, but you need to manually reset it for your sound input.  Easy enough after a few times, but confusing at first.<br /><br />Likes.  VG sound.  I previously had a Polk 5.1 system, but retired and we moved to a small condo.  Had to give it away.  So I have invested in HQ sound systems.  With optical, subwoofer sound is noticeable and adds to the system sound.  Where my Polk subwoofer sound output faced the floor, and boomed off the hardwood floor, this subwoofer sound is front facing, and relies on bouncing off the walls.  That's better if you have carpet, and not hardwood.  Voices are much clearer than my Vizio TV speakers.  Hated using closed caption so often.  That's why I got a soundbar.<br /><br />Likes.  Excellent and easy bluetooth pairing.  Paired immediately to my Iphone 5.  I have Amazon Prime, with free music streaming for many of my favorite songs.  Pulled up Amazon music on my Iphone, picked a song and wow - great sounding music.  Soundbar is worth the cost for this feature alone.<br /><br />Likes.  Subwoofer paired easily.<br /><br />Likes.  My Vizio TV remote controls the soundbar with a few exceptions.  Need the soundbar remote to switch to bluetooth.  Important functions are on the soundbar itself, if the remote breaks or gets lost.<br /><br />Likes.  Have it in front of the TV.  Low enough that it doesn't interfere with the TV remote.  Some soundbars would have covered the the Remote to TV receiver.<br /><br />My deduction is for the LED light feature.",positive,negative
B078QNMDYC,4.0,"These Tomot speakers are inexpensive and pretty decent. They are attractive, black with red accents. They aren’t super large.  To me they seem to be about 4x6. They are small enough to fit on a shelf, or by a laptop. They are easy to use. There are no directions, but right out of the box, you can plug them in the computer (via USB or audio jack). The sound quality is good. Jazz, classic, rock and R&B all sound great. These are relatively inexpensive.  They work with a variety of devices. Only drawback, when not playing music, but still plugged in, these speakers make a slight noise. So for a very small investment, you get a decent pair of speakers.",positive,positive
B009BV4V4K,4.0,"I purchased these replacement pads for my Bose QC-15 headphones as the old pads were torn and needed to be replaced. I selected this set of pads based on the positive reviews here on Amazon with the thought that they would be the same as the original pads. While they look the same, they are indeed slightly different.<br /><br />First things first - these pads are fairly easy to install though they do require a little persistence to get them to snap into place. The earphones themselves have small tabs around the edges designed to snap the pads' bases into place and hold securely, and if the pads are not snapped down they simply will not stay securely. The inner foam and cloth shield that covers the electronics is easy to install but I had trouble with the double-sided tape that holds them in place - the adhesive did not want to release the cover strip and I had real difficulty peeling that strip away without ripping the actual cloth.<br /><br />Once in place, the phones look exactly like they did when they were new, but I found three differences. First, the phones no longer fit into the case as easily as they once did. Instead of just turning the cups to lay flat and simply putting them in the case, now I have to mess with them slightly to fit into the case properly, though they can be made to fit. More noticeable, though, is that the pads are not as effective as the originals for passive noise canceling. A fan that I have in my office used to be canceled out almost completely with the combination of passive and active noise canceling but is now more audible than when the original pads were in place. I would not say the difference is enough to render the earphones' ability to cancel noise completely compromised, but they are definitely not the same. Finally, these replacement pads are just a little less supple and soft than the original pads. It is not all that noticeable until comparing the original and replacement pads side by side. You have to really be looking closely for the difference to notice it, but it's there.<br /><br />The difference in noise canceling ability is most noticeable when working in an environment with reverb. I use my phones to monitor sound coming through a professional sound board because these have always done an excellent job of eliminating reverb and leaving just what comes through the sound board. With these new pads in place, I can now hear a lot of reverb, even when I press the phones tight over my ears and have ensured that they completely cover my ears so it's not a gapping issue. The material is different, plain and simple.<br /><br />These are not bad replacement pads by any means. They are very good, they are comfortable and they do make these phones look brand new again. That said, they were not manufactured by Bose and there are some differences. When considering the cost difference between these and Bose parts, the trade-offs balance out favorably. If you have to have an exact match with the original pads, these are very close but not 100% identical. If you are satisfied with a [roughly] 90%-95% match, these pads work nicely for a lot less than original manufacturer pads.",positive,negative
B08NTP5RTN,5.0,"I did a lot of research as to what to get for my kids to replace their aging and damaged Samsung Tab A's. We decided that it was time to go to a Chromebook so that they could get more repetition with a standard keyboard and GoogleOS. They are still able to download all the PlayStore apps that they had on their tablets, but now with better hardware and longer support.<br />This model has 64GB of storage (with SD card option), so thats a huge upgrade. The RAM is 4GB, which is more than most cheap tablets these days, and you can tell. Its a LOT snappier than the Galaxys.<br />The 2in1 flip with the screen is my kids favorite part! They can use it like a ""real computer"" and then flip it to make a huge tablet screen instead. Much bigger than the 8"" screen they had before.<br />For an entry level chromebook, these are sturdy, snappy, and cheap! I dare you to find something better for preteens at this price point!<br />NOTE: some of the reviews here complain about the speaker quality/power. This was one of the only things I was weary about when I finally committed to this unit. Those reviews are DEAD WRONG. The speakers are GREAT on these Chromebooks. The quality is clear, and they are louder than both of my other laptops and tablets. Playing videos through YouTube at 1/2 volume is much louder than the max of my other units.

B07XQ325Y3,5.0,"When it comes to radios, so many of them just don't have the reception that they used to.  I came across this one and decided it was worth the try.  Unfortunately, the battery choice is annoying, but let's take a look at the radio..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a pretty straightforward radio.  It has AM and FM.  Each band has a horizontal dial on it.  The volume button is large and turns the radio on and off as well.  You can adjust the tone from high to low which will either focus on voice or on base tones for what you are listening to.<br /><br />HANDLE<br />The handle on this is sturdy and easy to carry.<br /><br />ANTENNA<br />The antenna on this is sturdy and easy to pull out and push in.<br /><br />JACK<br />There is a standard headphone jack.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This performs beautifully.  The reception is exceptional and I can pull in stations that most other newer radios do not pull in any more.  The sound is fabulous with a lot of depth to it.<br /><br />BATTERIES<br />I really dislike that this takes 4 D batteries.  Those batteries are expensive and tend to run out quickly.  I don't normally carry them in the house for emergencies, but it would be worth having some since this radio is great and easy to hear.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT LIKE THIS RADIO?<br />Anyone who loves to listen to AM still would love this radio.  Many of them don't have it anymore which is frustrating.  I also found that it is great for older people to have one of these.  I know an older gentleman who has been bed ridden and home bound and he loves this radio.  It is easy to operate, see, and great sound.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I like this radio.  It is good to have on hand for emergencies or for good listening when internet is down or I just am tired of the internet radio channels and prefer to be local.  The sound is great and operation easy.  Fabulous reception.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a perfect gift for older people or those who really enjoy local radio and prefer an easy to use radio that has great reception.  Just be sure to have D batteries for emergencies.

B09XQPWQJK,5.0,"I have a room on my property which gets cold and damp.  I was looking for a power strip that I could use in that room without having to worry about the dampness.  After using it, I am considering another one to use under one of my fish tanks.<br /><br />HOW THIS IS SET UP<br />This is set up beautifully for indoor or outdoor use.  The outlets make it easy to use all six plugs with transformer plugs if necessary.  The plug goes at an angle and is flush with the outlet instead of sticking out.<br /><br />IS IT WATERPROOF?<br />This does seem to withstand the brief time I had it outside with rain and other windy weather.  As I said, I wanted this to use for a damp room instead of outside, but it performed well outside through some rain storms.  I am not considering a second one of these for under one of my fish aquariums.<br /><br />CORD<br />I only wish that the cord was a bit longer.  For use outside, longer cords help to set things up better.  This one is very short for that.

B0B875GR1X,5.0,"[[VIDEOID:676a9c562ee284b4873a8774f1caf9d6]] With modern computers cutting down on the number of ports, relying on the speed of USB 3.1 Type-c to handle all of the I/O load, consumers now have to provide their own docks or dongles.  This means that we are dealing with more cables and what is termed ""dongle hell"".  This is just the reality, unfortunately.  It's both more convenient (a single cable to connect all of your accessories) and less convenient at the same time.<br /><br />Well, this isn't the fault of the HENRETY USB C Hub, it's just here to help resolve the problem that you are facing... and it does a good job of it.  The hub is sleek, with an aluminum shell and high-quality ports.<br /><br />In my use, I already have a small dongle to connect my laptop to an external monitor but I ran out of ports for it.  I needed more ports, but I didn't need another HDMI output.  I opted to save some money and get a simple USB hub and it really does work very well.  I have a backup external drive connected that I periodically backup my video editing projects to and I also have my Dualsense (PS5) controller connected to it.

B009FHFFIG,5.0,"The [[ASIN:B009FHFFIG Sennheiser Momentum Over-Ear Headphone]] are circumaural  which means they cover the whole ear and they have a closed-back.  They are lightweight, gorgeous with soft brown leather cushioned earpieces, have two easily switchable cables, one for general use and the second for specified mac devices.  A MacBook is not one of the specified devices, but my iPod is.  With its swivel plug and embedded on the cable remote, I'm sure iPhone and iPad users will be as thrilled as I was when I tried it on a friend's devices.  Crisp, clear, complete, these need no amplifier, but they do need ears which are not larger than average or the whole ear coverage is lacking and therefore, so is the desired effect of a circumaural earpiece.  I've listened to music on a MacBook, an android phone, a Kindle Fire, and tested these on the aforementioned iPad and iPhone.  In each and every case, the sound was outstanding and my ears did not tire, nor did they feel uncomfortable or overheated.  Most sounds surrounding me were not heard and those nearby did not hear what I was listening to at any time.  Watching movies is enhanced every time and I'm finding that even when impulsively finding a video on the Web in my usual activities, I tend to grab these headphones to listen instead of simply hearing through the computer.  My favorite music in these earphones thus far today has been John Coltrane's [[ASIN:B000V698WE A Love Supreme]].  I tend to switch genres throughout a day, but thought this was worth mentioning.  Nothing like really hearing the instrumentals as they were intended to be heard!  Outstanding headphones.",positive,positive

B07KK5P9Y1,4.0,"I've always wanted a wireless off camera monitor for director/crew use on our freelance camera operator gigs, or for when mounting the camera somewhere difficult to see like the side of a car. A few years ago, a solution like this would have cost upwards of $2k, but now thanks to products like this one we can do it on a shoestring budget!<br />I attached the transmitter to a USB battery bank and used gaffer's tape to attach to my camera cage with my Sony A7S inside. On the other side, I took a flash bracket and mounted a 7"" monitor, and once again used gaffer's tape to sandwich the receiver to another battery supply and secure to the handle of the bracket. Note that the receiver isn't designed to run off USB power like the transmitter is (why, I don't know), so I had to use a modified cable to make one end a USB - it is still only 5v, but I think it requires at least 2amps so it is pickier about what battery bank will work with it. My smaller battery supply didn't crank out enough power so it won't start (blue light would just blink), but a larger battery supply that I have did just fine.<br />Once the two were wired up, as a proof of concept I fired up the camera and had a live feed in full 1080p on the remote monitor, which worked fine as long as I was in the same room as the camera. Pretty useful! If you look at the included image, you can see both units on the floor working, but I'll need some shorter cables to clean it up in the future (didn't have any short cable available for this test, so it looks messy).<br />The only thing I wish Sabrent had done better is include a mount for the transmitter to attach to the camera hotshoe. They claim it comes with one in the box, and even show a picture of it mounted to a camera but it does NOT! It comes with a bracket that uses a thumb screw to attach to something, but it will only fit into a hotshoe if you have an adapter for your shoe mount that will accept a screw through it. The thumb screw and shoe mount that they show in the picture are not included in the box, which disappointed me. No matter, I'd still need a battery supply for this so I had to attach it to a cage anyway. But I felt like that picture was misleading in the product's image.<br />I also wish that they had made the receiver work off a standard USB plug as well so I wouldn't have to use a modified cable for it. It worked pretty well so I can't complain too much at the end of the day.<br />Although I was interested primarily in off camera monitoring, I discovered this device is very well suited to send your laptop's display to a TV. With the receiver on your TV wired up, the transmitter actually works like a dongle right out of the laptop's hdmi port, and just needs a short run of USB for power from the closest port. This is the cleanest use of this product that I can imagine, and it works well for that. Pretty amazing what it can do for the price these days!",positive,negative
B006TGQ9ZE,4.0,"I'm not a buyer of high-end ear buds.  At my age my hearing isn't acute enough to hear much of the nuance of music through headphones, but I do like the sound to be much better than if I were holding a can and string up to my ears.  That being said, these are the best earphones I've ever owned.  When I first put them on, the bass response actually startled me and the middles and highs were present and clear --without any adjustment to my player.  The ""stays in your ears"" feature actually works; you give them a twist in your ear and they stay put, as well as keeping out sweat.  You can hear ambient noise just fine, but unless there's a high wind or other competing sound, you continue to hear the audio just fine.<br /><br />I don't agree with other reviewers who report that the plastic earbuds fall off easily.  I think those reviewers must be actually pulling the buds off to clean them and I don't believe that's the manufacturers' intentions. I clean mine with a mini-fiber cloth well moistened (but not soggy) with rubbing alcohol without removing them from the actual earpieces.<br /><br />The reason I didn't give these earphone five stars is that there is no inline control --no mute off, or volume control.  I like them VERY much, and would buy them again if I needed to replace.",positive,positive
B003A2SRUK,4.0,"This Splat stuff is really interesting.  When I first got the jar, it was filled to the top with gooey shivery bright orange goo that is the same type of thing we used to get at the toy store and throw against the wall and watch it roll down.<br /><br />This glob of goo, however, is supposed to be used to clean crevices in your car- speakers, dials, switches, vents, etc, that you can not easily clean otherwise.  I did not use this goo right away, and almost a month later, I was surprised to see that the volume of the Splat goo went down by half.  It had shrunk- and no one had taken any out either.<br /><br />It is a bit weird to get used to using at first too, but it quickly becomes easy to manipulate into little places you want to clean.<br /><br />When using it, it really does work.  Little switches and indented areas that gather a lot of dirt and dust were cleaned well with no residue.  The only problems I had were two:<br /><br />---Don't drop it on the floor or it will grab every single stone, piece of dirt, or garbage it touches.<br /><br />---Don't let it touch the windows or it will leave a smudge that you can only see at night when lights are coming at you and it can be very distracting.  It does wash off relatively easily- but it takes a bit of work to get it back to the way it was.<br /><br />All in all, however, I like Splat.  As long as I don't drop it or let it touch any windows in the car, it does a good job.  It is only useable for 50 uses and that is not a whole lot- but it is biodegradable.  I have not used it up yet so I can not comment on the biodegradability of Splat.",positive,negative

B00MA0TEDW,5.0,"Note: there is a [[ASIN:B00QEY99DU Newer version] of this earpiece that I have also reviewed. Like that one I received this as a review sample.

Even at full list this is an ideal way to use your phone legally in locales that enforce hands free laws (and the number is growing.)<br /><br />It's also comfortable, which is surprising to me because I hate in-ear buds. In this case, the array f provided ear pieces in various sides ensures a good fit regardless of your age or size. Ironically the medium fit me perfectly.<br /><br />Sound quality for music is not spectacular, but more than adequate for casual listening. I made and received calls and the clarity of those on both ends were also adequate. Not spectacular, but not terrible. When you consider that this is less than twenty bucks at the time of this review then in that context you are getting more than you are paying for in that department.<br /><br />This may not be the best single ear headset on the market, but it's by far among the best in its price range - and since it is so inexpensive and does what it should do I am rating it five stars.",positive,positive
B074KBHW65,5.0,"I have used active noise canceling (ANC) headphones for many years and I have come to expect - and look for - the subtle differences between them. I have worked with ANC phones from Bose, Sennheiser, Monster, Noontec and quite a few more. All of them have their strengths and weaknesses. This is my first experience with Sony ANC phones, and I anticipated good ANC functionality and a solid sound profile. At the price point ($300 as I write this) they need to be excellent to be worth any kind of consideration. These were a huge shock to me: the ANC is nearly on par with Bose and the sound profile is solid, giving better results than I imagined.<br /><br />I will address the ANC function first, then the sound profile, and afterward I will discuss design and features. I apologize ahead of time for being long-winded, but I’d rather give too much feedback than not enough.<br /><br />The ANC function is, in a single word, outstanding. Bose is the standard by which I compare others and very, very few headphones get anywhere near the same level of noise cancellation as my Bose sets (QC-15 and QC-20i, by the way). Those that get close usually have the same weird pressure sensation for which Bose is known. My primary test is a loud fan that I use for generating white noise when I want to drown out everything around me at night. I turned the fan on high speed, plugged the Sony’s buds into my ears and turned them on. I put them in ANC mode and the fan all but disappeared. All that remained of the noise was a faint, higher-frequency hiss (distinct from the ANC hiss which I will explain later). Of all the phones I have used, this set and the Bose are the only ones to wipe out that much noise. I also went into the bathroom and turned on the ventilation fan to test, and these phones again wiped out a large majority of the fan noise. For this fan, the Bose sets have a very slight edge but you have to be looking for it to notice.<br /><br />The main difference between the Bose sets and these is the utter lack of that weird pressure sensation with these. If you don’t like that sensation but you want very high ANC, these are simply excellent. Like a lot of ANC phones, these generate a faint hiss that you really won’t notice unless you’re not feeding any sound at all to them and you’re listening for it.<br /><br />The sound profile is also quite solid. Usually with ANC phones, because of the cancellation of certain bandwidths the phones compensate by twiddling the sound profile to fill in what was dropped, and usually this means overcompensation in the bass range (if you use Dre Beats, you know exactly what I mean). Heavy bass gives me headaches so I avoid headphones where the bass has been given too much boost. With these, Sony did not overdrive the bass at all but it’s still very solid and full - love it. The midrange is very warm and rich and music has the right depth. The highs are very bright and clear but not piercing. Overall, I am very pleased with the sound profile - not audiophile quality but closer than most.<br /><br />In terms of design, these are a wireless earbud product with a neck harness. So, these are neither on-ear or over-ear phones. The harness and slack but adjustable wiring to the actual earbuds ensures that they can be set up so they won’t tug or pull when you’re working out, running or otherwise doing physical activity. Being wireless, there’s no cord to tangle up either. And, one size really does fit all which is a problem with some regular phones. The neck assembly has a leatherette padding that is soft and will not chafe.<br /><br />The Bluetooth functionality works great. I paired these to my phone and they paired and connected in less than 5 seconds which is really all I could ask. After a full power-off, I turned them back on and they immediately connected to my phone again. I have no complaints there.<br /><br />One of the really interesting features of these is the ability to turn off the ANC and use them without any cancellation, but they have another unusual mode that I have only seen in one other pair of phones - they have an “ambient sound” mode that you can turn on that dampens the feed in the buds and slightly increases the surrounding noise without turning off the ANC. Assuming the volume is not turned up too loud, this allows for carrying on a conversation without turning off the feed. I will say, though, that listening to my own voice coming through in this mode is disconcerting.<br /><br />I do not know yet how long the battery in these lasts. So far I have not run them all the way down.<br /><br />Included in the box are the phones themselves, a conversion cable so that they can be used with an audio jack (handy when Bluetooth is not an option), a cable for charging, an in-flight audio adapter, several silicone tips fo the buds so you can get the size right, and a protective carry bag.<br /><br />The carry bag is the only complaint I have with the whole package - it offers little protection from drops and crushes. If you only are concerned about keeping everything together and keeping the set very clean, the bag is acceptable, but if you need better protection that consider getting a third-party hard case or use the original packaging box.<br /><br />Sony got these right and even at the price tag these are easy to recommend. They’re comfortable (more comfortable than I expected for ear buds), they have excellent sound and the ANC function is outstanding. I prefer these to my Bose phones and will be using these instead.",positive,negative
B07XL4XSPB,3.0,"I just ordered this for my 7th generation iPad and the case itself appears to be almost indestructible. In fact it is so well put together that it takes about 30 minutes just to install it with the iPad.<br /><br />INSTALLATION<br />- Pull the stand off the case.<br /><br />- Remove the silicone outer rim from the cover. I found removing the silicone rim hard to figure out until I took my fingernail to peel if off the track that goes around the entire top of the case. It gets peeled off from the outermost edge.<br /><br />- Unhinge the miniscule snaps (by the arrows) located around the case in order to open it. Once again, my stubby fingernails came in handy. It is only then that the iPad can be inserted.<br /><br />- Insert the iPad into the open case. Make sure it is facing correctly based on the orientation of the case.<br /><br />- DO NOT remove the plastic film covering the home button that is on the clear plastic case top. I did not know this and removed it and it damaged the cover with glue (see photos).  It removed cleanly on all but one side where tremendous glue residue was left behind. The plastic film was partially up before I even began pulling it off and is typical of the type film I see covering watch faces, etc. so naturally I removed it as there was no mention not to in the manual.<br /><br />- Re-fasten the top and ""snap"" it into place.<br /><br />- Re-attach the silicone rim. Make sure that the rim once again is pulled up and over the top of the case and that the silicone edge is pushed into the track around the case. If it is not seated in the track, the case will not be sealed correctly.<br /><br />With regard to the large smear of glue residue left behind by the thin plastic film that covered the home button. I contacted support to find out what can be used to remove this residue but there was nothing they could recommend with the iPad inside. They did say possibly hand sanitizer because it had alcohol in it but that should not touch the iPad. A damp rag did not work nor did a rag with water. This is extremely upsetting to me because it mars an otherwise nice looking case. However, they are sending me a replacement case with a possible return label for the ""new"" damaged case. I will update my review after I receive the new case.<br /><br />The stand is detachable and has two heights that can be used in four positions. What this means is that the low stand can be used with the iPad in the portrait or landscape postion. The stand can then be reversed for standing up the iPad in the portrait or landscape postion. I personally only like the landscape position for either height as it feels like the iPad is going to fall using in portrait mode.<br /><br />Also note that the stand is not easy to just snap on and off of the case if one is storing it there. It takes a little bit of effort and time. Although, it can be snapped on the case for portability, I have chosen not to do this because of this difficulty. Instead I just choose to lay the stand on top of the iPad so it is easily put into service.<br /><br />In summary, this is an excellent case that offers superb protection for the iPad. The case is extremely heavy. It is almost like carrying a laptop around from the olden days. I love the low stand angle with the iPad in the landscape position; in fact, that is the only way I like the stand. This postion is perfect for typing on the iPad as if one is typing on a keyboard.  I am, however, very upset about the glue left behind from the plastic circle strip that covered the home button which I should not have removed but which was not mentioned in the manual. Had my cover not been destroyed by this glue, I would have rated this 4 stars. If there was no glue residue and the stand was part of the cover and was not so heavy, I would have rated this 5 stars.  I personally prefer a stand that is attached to the case. This requires setup each time as a separate piece.<br /><br />UPDATE: I updated my review above regarding the home button sticker I pulled off. Otter box said it was not supposed to get removed because it is a fully enclosed system. I asked them to update their documentation to say this so others do not make the same mistake I did. I will post another update after my new case arrives and perhaps update this review to 4 stars if it is satisfactory.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/29/20 - I finally got my replacement Otter Box and it is working fine. I now know not to remove that plastic film over the Home Button even if it looks like it is falling off or should come off.",positive,negative
B00PTOAAO8,5.0,"One of the issues with some tower cases is the placement of USB ports. Some of the newer cases have USB ports on the front but often these are USB 2.0. Even when there are 3.0 ports on the front of the case it seems there need to be one or two more. AVANTEK's 5.25"" drive bay USB add-on hub adds three USB ports as well as a 2.4A charging port.<br /><br />The hub has two internal plugs. One is for power and one is for the USB bus. Be sure that your case and motherboard can support USB 3.0 and has the proper plugs.<br /><br />Once installed, the three ports are immediately available to the operating system and they work like the other USB ports on the system. The USB speeds are best realized with something like a USB 3.0 storage device like an external hard drive, though USB 1.1 devices like mice and keyboards work just fine on this hub too.<br /><br />What makes this hub interesting is actually the 2.4A charging port. This is very convenient for charging a cell phone, a tablet or similar device. My chosen device for testing chargers is a Magellan Roadmate GPS navigator, which is an ornery device that will not charge when powered on unless using the car charger that came with it. I selected a high-speed USB cable and plugged in my navigator and it charged up quickly when powered off. However, the navigator slowly drained faster than it charged when powered on. This was expected though it was worth a shot.<br /><br />I am especially encouraged at how solid this device is - the ports are securely soldered to the PC board and the board itself is mounted on several posts to the frame which makes it much less likely to flex and ultimately break. I applied some direct pressure to the PC board (not a realistic scenario in use but a good test before installation) and the board really did not flex much at all.<br /><br />I can't find any real issues with this hub. It's a solidly built device, it mounts easily and once connected provides 3 USB ports and a charging port on the front of a computer tower case. It is reasonably priced too which makes it a very good buy.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",positive,negative

B079J2FSQ7,4.0,"NOTE: This review is written for the Small, Bluetooth edition.<br /><br />I have been using Wacom Intuos and Bamboo tablets for years, not really for graphic arts but more for digital handwriting and for use as an alternative to traditional mice and trackballs. My present solution is an Intuos 5 medium which seems to be about the right fit for my hands and my work space. The one drawback has been that it’s a wired solution. This new Intuos is a Bluetooth solution and it is definitely a step forward. For me the challenge is downgrading to the small from the medium, but it’s a good fit for me when traveling and when working in cluttered spaces.<br /><br />To approximate the size, it is roughly equivalent to 7” tablet in size. It’s small enough to tuck away in a corner of a desk when not in use, and when it is being used it does not take up large amounts of real estate. The design itself makes it suitable for use just about anywhere it can be set down and kept stable - one of the reasons I like drawing tablets more than traditional mice.<br /><br />The Bluetooth connectivity is new to me, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that this unit can connect via USB as well. So, if your system is like one of mine and the Bluetooth doesn’t work, this drawing tablet still will work.<br /><br />I have it connected to my Windows 10 system. I have not yet made the effort to get it working with my Linux system, though I expect there will be some labor involved to make that work. I’ll revisit that later.<br /><br />In operation, this is a straightforward drawing tablet though it is an improvement over my Intuos 5 in some ways. Of course the Bluetooth is a step up, but I was surprised by the increased number of pressure levels which is effectively doubled over my old tablet - 4096 vs 2048. For someone like me, this is not a huge difference and I don’t take advantage, but for someone who is very serious about fine digital artwork this can be a huge benefit. For use in handwriting, it is not especially important as even 512 pressure levels (like my original Bamboo small) is more than sufficient.<br /><br />When you register, you get a choice between three Corel titles, of which you can select two (for the medium you get all three). Some may find the choice difficult - Painter Essentials 6, AfterShot 6 and Clip Studio Paint Pro (2 years) - but for me, having AfterShot is more than enough.<br /><br />There is a downside to this little tablet, though - the pen is mediocre. There is no comfort grip, changing the nib is a pain, and there’s a very limited number of replacement nibs for it. It’s the one weak spot in an otherwise nice product, and even then it’s not all that bad.<br /><br />The hardest part for me with this specific tablet is the move from a medium to a small, but this this counterbalanced by the Bluetooth connectivity and the inclusion of the Corel titles, specifically AfterShot. This is a very nice drawing solution and is it priced nicely. I’d recommend the small for anyone either just getting started or experimenting; the medium is a better fit for those more experienced or needing more real estate. I would choose a different pen if available, though.",positive,positive

This is out and playing because it deserves to be heard!  I don’t recommend this for young children the will put their fingers thru the speaker by picking it up.  This is for those who appreciate great sound!,positive,positive
B0863GY4MT,2.0,"I hate to write this review,  since these have the best sound I've heard comparing to Sony (wired) 7506s. The sound on these is excellent.  It's everything else that fails,  eventually causing me to return them after a couple days.  I'm currently trying Cowin E7s.<br /><br />The humorously deep ear pads aren't bad and that's where I think they get most if their bass response from,  as the ""extra"" deep bass is non-existent as far as the electronics are concerned.  To repeat,  these are absolutely not for bassheads. Nothing like Anker. I'm not a basshead so this worked out for me.  Panasonic repeatedly gets an almost Sony sound; bright highs and balanced mids.<br /><br />However they did press against my temples a little too much and I can see them causing someone a headache after awhile. Again I'm not susceptible so it wasn't a problem for me. The bluetooth,  unfortunately,  has interrupts about every 20 minutes.  Unlike others,  I have never experienced this phenomena with any other bluetooth device or phone.  My inexpensive Mpows don't do this. And,  sigh, the stupid bass switch RATTLES. With loud volume and pop/rock bass you won't hear it.  Listening to classical or jazz with these would be impossible.  They creak.  The plastic is super lightweight,  cheaply built,  and poorly designed.  Trying to enjoy music in a rocking chair after awhile will get to you.  Again none of my other headphones do this.<br /><br />Bottom line,  super balanced sound (NOT bassy despite their advertising) but poorly designed with cheap materials and subpar bluetooth which defeats enjoying the great sound.  Really too bad.<br /><br />Until Anker and Sony have a baby...",negative,negative

B0791H74NT,5.0,"My sound system on my work pc isn’t the best. Internal speakers are often not the best quality- you need an external speaker set if you want the enjoy better overall sound. This need convinced me to add Creative Pebble 2.0 USB-Powered Desktop Speakers to my office.<br /><br />These speakers are round and are angled at approximately 45 degrees. This is good, because it aims the sound more directly at you, when you’re sitting at a desk. The sound quality is generally good, especially for this price range. There is a volume control on one of the speakers, which controls both. If you feel you can’t get the desired volume, don’t forget to check your existing volume, on your pc. The control on these speakers works with your built- in speakers volume control.<br /><br />I really like the bass delivered by these speakers. When you consider how small these speakers are, it is not something you would expect. Oh, and speaking of the size, they are small enough to fit into tight quarters. They are less then five inches wide, so you should have no problem finding a place on your desktop to sit them.<br /><br />These speakers come in either white or black, to fit your décor. I picked black because it matches best with my color scheme. II like what I have and, again, for the price point it would be difficult to find a set of speakers any better than Creative Pebble 2.0 USB Powered Desktop Speakers. They are easily worth the small investment.",positive,positive
B07K7YC1R8,2.0,"Headphones are beautiful in appearance and light up nicely when on, but the problem occured while playing online. Multiple times the device would cut off speech. There would be many times where we had to go through a whole set up of going into the computer and resetting the settings to make sure it was connected. It should have been as easy as plugging in, but NO we had to go to settings just to fix issues. Very annoying!! It also echoed at times. I couldn't believe this was happening with a new set of headphones that I just bought as a gift for my fiance's birthday. Very disappointed.",negative,negative

B000HI7OZ4,5.0,"This is a review for the TK-408 switch.  I noticed the reviews seem to show up on several different models.  This model has the round PS/2 type connections for mouse and keyboard, and female connections for VGA. It also has audio connections, so you can use one set of speakers for several different computers. There are no USB connections on it.  All the cables are included.  I use this to switch between PCs; some reviewers mentioned trouble with MACs.  The only real issue I have encountered is that if I power up a computer that is off and I am currently switched to another computer, when I go back to the one that was off (that is now on), the screen resolution has dropped.  If I switch to the turned off computer while it still off and power up and boot up before switching away, there is no issue and then I can switch back and forth all day with everything staying as it should be.  It's just a very minor annoyance.  If the computers you are switching between are always on, it would never be an issue.  The other thing that I found out is that for me the audio was not of much use.  The reason is that I am often listening to music on one computer; when I wanted to switch to another computer to do some work, the sound stopped, obviously because now I was on another computer that didn't have music playing.  I ended up just hooking up 3 sets of speakers for my 3 computers.  A lot of space used up, but a better solution for me.  The sound situation is not a problem with the switch, as it was doing exactly what it should by looking for output from the line out on the computer that you are switched to.  Some reviewers mentioned problems with delay in the hotkey switching.  I haven't noticed this and usually it takes no more than one second to switch.  My switch uses ScrLk twice followed by the port number the computer is on.  I have tried out two more expensive switches that don't have hotkey capability and you have to press a button on the switch.  With Trendnet switches, you can do either - use the keyboard sequence or press the physical key on the switch.  I have had this switch in service for a number of years and the only physical issue I have encountered is that once in a while the master keyboard and mouse connections loosen up and have to be re-seated.  The switch has given me many years of flawless operation and so far has proven to perform better than much more expensive switches.  Very good value for the price and I highly recommend it.  I like Trendnet equipment so far and have some other products of theirs that also work very well.",positive,negative
B07Y7BFXVM,5.0,"I currently own an El Gato HD60S, a ClearClick 4k PC-less capture card, and this Unisheen capture card. Of the three cards, this Unisheen does not require a HDMI splitter to bypass HDCP for my smart devices. This a pleasant surprise! However, I did have audio issues to begin with. It was not capturing the audio of the Fire Stick. It would only capture external sound by microphone. I was scratching my head for the longest time, and I even emailed Unisheen for tech support. But on a hunch, I restarted my PC, and that was all it took. LOL! You know the saying.. When in doubt? Well, just remember at the computer, when something isn't working right...

B004M8ST5O,5.0,"It's easy to love this elegant little MP3 player.  It's thin and compact (3/8"" x 2"" x  3-5/8""), and feels really great when held in the hand.  It has the basic features that on-the-go people will use and appreciate:  (1)  a music player, (2) a video player, (3) an audiobook player, (4) photo storage, (5) text file storage [no docs], (6) a radio [FM only], and (7) a sound recorder.  It allows you to set up playlists and slide shows, and to easily record reminders, memoranda, or other things (e.g., grocery lists, parking locations, inspired thoughts).<br /><br />If you're not fussy about sound quality (and I'm not), the built-in speakers give OK sound.  The supplied earplugs give much better sound, especially when the music player is set to deliver ""full sound"".  In addition, you can get pretty good ""room"" sound by plugging a portable external speaker system like the [[ASIN:B0054QNL38 AmazonBasics Portable Stereo System for MP3 Players]] into the earphones outlet. The built-in software includes a nice ""SafeSound"" feature that helps you set your earplug or headphones volume at a level that won't cause long-term hearing loss.<br /><br />With the supplied USB cable, your desired media content can be easily transferred from a PC running WinXP-SP3 or Vista or Win7 by using the Windows Media Player or File Manager.  However, the device is actually intended to be used with the supplied ""Philips Songbird"" software.  You will need to install the Songbird software in order to update the firmware (which I was able to do successfully).  If Songbird works on your computer, it is certainly the best and easiest software manager for the Ariaz device. Unfortunately, Songbird didn't work well on my computer (my security software, NIS 2012, says that Songbird is safe but somewhat unstable).  Fortunately, the Songbird software gives you a clear option to use Windows Media Player, instead of Songbird, to manage your device.<br /><br />The 8GB of memory holds quite a few albums worth of songs--certainly there is more than enough storage space for the material you might want to carry around with you (some family photos, your favorite music, an audiobook, your memos to yourself).<br /><br />Because this was my first MP3 player, I encountered a steep learning curve.  The Quick Start guide told me to plug the player into a computer, but little more.  When plugged in, the device automatically began charging and installing the Songbird software.  When that was finished, Songbird offered to sync the device to my computer's music library.  However, the Songbird interface is not particularly easy for beginners to use, and because of my inexperience with music downloads, it took me a while to figure out how to transfer music.<br /><br />Also, I was initially baffled by the device's menus and apparent lack of up/down and left/right navigation buttons.  Although the Quick Start guide includes a schematic drawing that depicts the device's physical buttons, I didn't notice the tiny dots that were representing the directional navigation buttons.  On the device itself, the surface around the central ""do it"" button is perfectly smooth--except for four tiny incised dots, that are invisible unless you hold the device at the correct angle to the light.  Until I downloaded the full user's manual from the Philips web site, I had no idea that up/down and left/right navigation was accomplished by pressing those incised dots. (You can feel the navigational buttons when you press them, once you know they're there.)<br /><br />I would strongly recommend that anyone who purchases this sleek and delightful little device start by downloading the full user's manual.  You can find the manual in the Support section of the Philips web site by entering Ariaz model no. SA3ARA08K/37 .  The manual tells you how to get started, and also gives lots of good tips on importing different types of files, generating playlists, and adding and deleting items from the device.<br /><br />Another problem that I encountered was a complete overnight battery discharge--when I locked the device to turn it off, instead of turning the device completely off by holding down the on/off button until the screen said ""Bye"".  When the device is completely turned off after use, it holds the battery charge as expected.<br /><br />At present, Philips doesn't seem to have a case for this particular MP3 player.  A case that works for me--because I carry the device in a tote bag--is the [[ASIN:B0032EVXFW CaseCrown Double Memory Foam Compact MP3 Case]].  There is an elastic strap that holds the player on the right, and a mesh pocket that holds the short USB cable on the left.  The earplugs can then be added, loose, between the device and the mesh pocket when you zip up the case.",positive,negative

I'd prefer they just have wires running out the back only, but what can you ya do.<br /><br />Lastly if you have two phone that are connected to the Bluetooth audio then you have to go into the setting manually to switch between which phone can play music through it, even if the phone that is currently connected isn't playing music or even near the car.<br /><br />Overall, the stereo works well.

B07X3T416J,5.0,"I wanted a dual set because we have two backseat drivers that need distraction. Well, maybe they just need a better driver but in any case I needed a DVD player set. I decided on these based on the reviews and am thoroughly impressed.<br /><br />There is a built in battery which has served us well given I didn’t realize that at first and while driving the DVD player stopped. I thought it was broke and then realized it had just not been plugged in properly. After reading through I was pleasantly surprised by this feature.<br /><br />My kids like the ease of access and to be able to use the remote. I really like the lack of skipping that occurs while driving as a previously set we had would skip and then restart the disc. No issues in that regard here.<br /><br />The audio is great though we have the kids wear headphones as usually we have a few different sounds happening (radio, wifes phone, older sons phone, and DVD player would just add to that). I did listen to it at first as I didn’t want to have the headphones given it’ll only be a few years before he wears them all the time (teen years are fun).<br /><br />If there were a downside to these, it is something that happens to all DVD players in that when cold, the laser reader has to warm before it can read the disc.

B00CD1PTF0,5.0,"Have been using the companion 2 series 2 speakers for several years and was very happy with them.  When I saw the series 3 at a local store I decided to see if they were any better than the series 2.  They are exactly the same size.  They are now black, rather than gray. I like the black more than the gray.  The input jacks are now mini jacks rather than the RCA jacks on the series 2, which is an improvement.  The series 3 can be turned off with the volume control, the series 2 had no on/off control.  It was on all the time.  The series 3 draws so little power I leave them on all the time anyway.  NOW THE BIG QUESTION:  DO THEY SOUND BETTER THAN THE SERIES 2?  In my opinion, they sound exactly the same as the series 2 they replaced. So unless you want any of the features new to the series 3, I would recommend saving your money.  The series 2 was a great product, and so is the series 3.  Bose makes outstanding products.",positive,negative

B07QN8K455,4.0,"Let me start off by saying I work in freelance video and I love how much I can fit inside this case! I've been using a Pelican 1510 as my go-to travel carrier, so that's mostly what I'm comparing this to. For starters, this is a longer case so in addition to my cameras, lenses, batteries and other accessories, it  has a long open sleeve that can even fit a light stand or small tripod! For extra versatility, the whole interior can actually be pulled out (it has its own handle straps if you want to use it as its own carrier), which then frees up the ample storage space inside the case as a separate  giant unit (see pictures to illustrate). There are also plenty of pockets on the inside, as well as the outside and front of the case. Of course, for a case this size there is the requisite wheels and carrying handle.<br />The only things I like better about my Pelican case, however, are the toughness and waterproofing. This bag comes with a rain cover which you can keep inside the case, however I don't like the idea of having to carry around a cover inside the bag, then take it out and put it on if it starts raining. The Pelican cases are air tight by simply closing them, no rain cover needed. The Pelican cases also are tough enough that they can be stacked under other equipment, thrown into a corner, sat on, stood on, etc, and 99% of the time come out unscathed. That's more than I can say for this bag. I bring this bag on gigs that I'm not worried about those things happening, because I can fit what I normally take in 3 separate bags into just this one. You could get a Pelican style case in this size, however it would cost quite a bit more than the asking price of this one. I think for the price this is a great tool to keep your stuff organized and ready to go whenever you are!",positive,negative

B0778V7RVR,3.0,"I wanted to find a cheaper alternative to my wife's wireless Bose headset, something with decent noise cancelling for flights and work.  So far I've used Bose, the MPOW H5, Treblab, and Woltix with ANC.<br /><br />The sound on these are first class -  really great highs, mids, and lows - tons of clarity (when active noise cancel is on...otherwise it sounds a bit muggy).  Very comfortable and light.  BUT - I got these because they are wireless with active noise cancellation, and although the ANC is effective, if you are in a quiet room you'll hear a slight hiss when the ANC is on - many people report the same thing in reviews, and it's true - you'll hear it.  You won't notice this when music is on or during a flight.  I often use these at coffee shops just to zone out and focus on work, and I could notice the slight hiss in quieter environments.<br /><br />I've also used Bose, the MPOW H5, and Woltix with ANC.  I didn't want to buy another Bose headset when my wife and I travel together.  Nothing will compare to Bose noise cancellation, but the MPOW H5 and Woltix are actually really nice for the money.  The MPOW H5 don't have as good audio clarity as the Treblab, but at the end of the day I got noise cancelling headphones for the noise canceling.  I ended up returning the Treblab and the MPOW H5 and I kept the Woltix because they are more comfortable than the MPOW and had the best low-price ANC.  The MPOW also had some sound interference issues randomly when the ANC was on.<br /><br />So:<br /><br />Bose:  Best noise cancellation, good audio, comfortable, but definitely expensive!<br />Treblab:  Best audio, worst noise cancellation (you can hear a slight hiss when turned on), comfortable, but large and they don't fold down too small.<br />MPOW:  Good audio, good noise cancellation, but was getting some weird sound interference with the ANC on sometimes.

Bear in mind that this and the case to which I am comparing it are the same price.<br /><br />I do wish there were more dividers included, and also that the long dividers would go across the entire width. However, for my purposes what came with this case is more than sufficient.<br /><br />One final point of comparison - I believe that in the long run the Tough box will outlast this one because of design and materials. That one is all plastic, while this one is a combination of materials that over time are going to break if roughly handled. That said, I prefer this case and will probably order a few more for some other microphones that I own.",positive,negative
B08RDK5V8J,5.0,"This is head-and-shoulders better than the cheapo webcams out there. Many webcams claim to be 1080p but actually either don't have the sensor or lens to actually resolve that much resolution, rather you get an up-sampled low resolution image in a 1080p frame. But not this one! This seems to have a properly sampled image which explains why it costs a little more than your average cheapo. The microphones are OK, they aren't great, but I always prefer using a headset or external mic anyway. I sit too far away from my screen to reply on camera mics. It won't compete with 4K brand name webcams, but in my opinion this can hold its own very well and does an admirable job for the money. It is definitely better than the built in cam on my old laptop, and adds a lot of value to my desktop for meetings. I recommend it for the price.",positive,positive

B008MF3OEY,5.0,"[[VIDEOID:mo4US5M5XC9DUY]]This case, the VERSO PROLOGUE (MARBLED BLUE),  is so pretty, I'm going to use it for my Kindle Keyboard even though it doesn't fit quite as well as the case I've been using (the [[ASIN:B003DZ165W Kindle Lighted Leather Cover, Black (Fits Kindle Keyboard)]] ).  Because the Verso cover is designed to fit a number of e-readers, and the Kindle Keyboard is the thinnest, the cover's ""book spine"" is a little wider than I'd like.  But the spine itself is fun, showing a gold-stamped book title,""Verso II"".<br /><br />I tried this case with all of my small e-readers:  the 1st Gen Kindle Fire, the Kindle Keyboard, and the Nexus 7.  As you can see from the accompanying video slide show, the case works (or as the manufacturer would say, ""is compatible with"") all three.  However, depending on the device, you may have to adjust the elastic bands so that they don't cover important keys or buttons.<br /><br />The best fit is with the 1st Gen Kindle Fire.  The device's power button and ports are at the center bottom, and the ambient light sensor is at the upper left corner, so the case's elastic bands interfere with nothing. The Kindle Keyboard is a good fit.  The case's elastic bands come close to covering the outside keyboard keys at the lower left and right, but the bands can be pushed back for clearance; and the bands don't interfere with the Keyboard's power button on the lower edge. The Nexus 7 (which is slightly larger than the Fire, and slightly thicker than the Keyboard) is a snug fit, but the case still works.  The elastic band at the top right must be pushed back to clear the Nexus 7 power and volume buttons located on the side  edge at the top right.  Although the case covers the Nexus 7 speaker on the back, the sound is the same whether the tablet is in or out of the case.<br /><br />Once adjusted, the elastic bands stay in place, because there is a rubbery material on the underside of the elastic that grips the surface beneath it. (I have screen protector film on my Kindle Fire and Nexus 7, which seems like a good idea whenever a case holds the e-reader by elastic bands instead of a hard plastic shell.)  This Verso case lacks any elastic closure, magnetic closure, or automatic wake/sleep feature.  However, the case stays closed fairly well (like a book), and offers good protection if your device is placed carefully (not tossed) into a bag or tote.  There is a pocket on the inside cover that is supposedly for ""important papers"", but it only holds a few thin items.  Apparently you can use this pocket to hold your e-reader when the cover is folded back.<br /><br />According to the retail literature that comes with it, the Verso Prologue Marbled Blue case is ""compatible"" with the Kindle Fire, Kindle Keyboard, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7.0), NOOK, Kobo Wi-Fi, Kobo Vox, Sony Reader Daily Edition, Sony Reader Wi-Fi, BlackBerry Playbook, HTC Flyer, Dell Streak 7, and other 7"" tablets (e.g., the Nexus 7).  This case is extremely well made, using superior materials, and makes your e-reader look like a beautiful handmade book.",positive,positive
B094YN85V2,5.0,"I researched soundbars on youtube and written reviews on just about every site I could find on all soundbars. Hours upon hours. Everything kept leading me back to the Bose 900. I was a little hesitant with reviews that mentioned how hard it was to set up and the app not working well. I'll just say I had zero issues with any of this. From taking it out of the box and setting it up , everything went seamlessly. Now maybe I got really lucky, but again, zero issues.<br /><br />As far as the sound, it is exactly what I was wanting and more. I was concerned about my ceiling height which is angled and 12ft high at the highest point. I'll just say watching Dune exceeded my expectations. I heard sounds all the way around me. Maybe Im also lucky with my room set up, but it performed better than i expected.<br /><br />I am using the soundbar by itself with no additional sub or surround speakers. The soundbar gives me more than enough bass and as far as surround im more than impressed. The dialogue is exactly what i wanted, etc.<br /><br />I highly recommend the calibration from the get go. I never bothered with the standard settings and just did the calibration from the start.<br /><br />All in all this thing met all the requirements. I may get the Bose 700 surround as extra enhancement, but I still feel its not fully needed. The Bose 900 does it all in my case.<br /><br />One other thing is that some content might not sound the same, which is normal for any set up, but adjusting the settings from the app couldnt be anymore easier and i dont feel its a complaint. I guess if taking a minute to adjust a movie bothers you, well then so be it",positive,negative
B0094S37GS,4.0,"I truly love these headphones for style.  They are a little bulky but you can tell that style was high on the designer's list.  I have been using a pair of Sennheiser headphones exclusively and I feel that the sound on these are a little crisper and the sound canceling is comparable.  I have no complaints at all on the corded sound these produce.  I'm a little less happy with the Bluetooth which works well when close to the bluetooth source and have a line of sight between the two.  These work beautifully when listening to books on tape on walks - perhaps a little too well and cutting me off from the environment.<br /><br />I do wish they would fold up a little smaller, so Sennheiser will continue to be my traveling headphones, but these have found a place wired to my computer for late night music and video enjoyment. The price is a little high for dedicated wired headphones though.",positive,positive
B005EJAU9S,4.0,"Let's cut to the chase, shall we?<br /><br />This tablet is flawed. The drivers with the CD, as others have stated, are outdated. You have a choice of getting your PenPad drivers from either the Yiynova website, or alternatively there is a slightly newer version currently available from Waltop themselves. MAKE SURE YOU UNINSTALL ALL WACOM DRIVERS. I can't emphasize this enough - they can and will screw everything up and turn the hardest part (installing drivers) into a nightmare ordeal. Uninstall them, do a restart, and get the new drivers in there. Make sure you see Wacom's website for uninstall instructions, as there are additional files that you have to track down and delete to ensure they're fully gone.<br /><br />After fiddling with the drivers, then comes the pen. The battery that came with mine showed up DOA, so I tried a fresh one. I can see the red 'on' light flash briefly when screwing the two components of the pen stylus together, but didn't find out until about an hour of frustration that you must screw the pen TIGHTLY together - do it with the pen on so you can see the red light come on and stay on when you've sufficiently tightened the barrel. Unfortunately, this also cascades into the rubber grip popping the side buttons slightly out of place when you're tightening it. A minor annoyance, easily corrected by shifting the rubber grip and gently pressing the buttons back into place, but still a bit of a design flaw that could be much improved upon.<br /><br />I also noticed, with much confusion, that the on-screen tablet does not work outside of art programs like Paint Tool SAI and Adobe Illustrator. The cursor simply goes dead until you use a mouse to click back into one of those programs and then the on-screen tablet comes back to life. I'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to react or if there are still some issues regarding the drivers.<br /><br />In spite of all this, you may notice that I still gave the tablet 4 stars. When the tablet works, it works very well. I've been spoiled by the pressure sensitivity of the Intuos4 for several years now, but the tradeoff of pressure for the ease and boost in productivity I've seen since working on the MSP19 is so worth it. It takes some getting used to if you've never worked with an on-screen tablet, but the learning curve is not steep at all. There is some discrepancy between where the tip of your pen is and where the cursor is on the screen, but you'll encounter this even with Cintiqs and I grew accustomed to it very quickly - just within an hour or two of initial use.<br /><br />Weight-wise, the monitor has a bit of heft to it, but it's not unmanageable. The adjustable stand in the back is a very nice addition, and I've found that this tablet rests comfortably in my lap if I need to get up close. It's easy to pick up and move around as needed if you don't want to buy the adjustable stand add-on. My only lament is the lack of hotkey buttons, which I hope will be included in future models.<br /><br />If you're like me and you're agonizing on whether to go with the 10"" model or the 19"", stop wondering and spring for the 19"". It's a third of the price of the newest (and smallest) Cintiq models with highly comparable specs. You have more space to make wide, sweeping gestures, and you will save yourself a lot of pain and hand cramping since you have a ton of real estate to work with.<br /><br />Despite its shortcomings, I am extremely happy with this tablet and hope to see the company take their success further into the future with better, sleeker, and more responsive models. Wacom could use some healthy competition.",positive,negative

B0855DPD85,4.0,"I purchased this 12.9'"" iPad Pro keyboard case and have been using it pretty regularly for a few months. The key travel height is comfortable, and accuracy has been excellent.

I would love to find this Bluetooth keyboard available for laptops.<br /><br />This backlit iPad keyboard and trackpad was probably the least expensive model ($35) at the time, and  I wasn't expecting much, but I took a chance and I am glad I did. It paired quickly, and it was easy to connect the trackpad feature via accessibility settings.<br /><br />The RGB lighting is around the keys, and I would have preferred it if the letters were translucent and lit up as well.<br /><br />My only complaint would be the rigid frame on the case. It made me a bit nervous, and felt like I had to force it a bit, but it fit well once I got it in. I wish it were a bit softer and more flexible at the corners.<br /><br />Overall, I would say it's a good value and would recommend it.",positive,positive
B08LV37HDD,3.0,"I listen to lectures on headphones when doing chores around the house and often can't hear people trying to get my attention. I've seen neck speakers before, and I thought it would be a very cool option for me as my family gets kind of annoyed that I can't hear them and they can't tell if I'm currently listening to something.<br />But I'll be honest, after trying these, I'm not really loving them. I had a pair of sunglasses speakers that aimed sound towards my ears, but this sort of blasts sound out and around me. Like, not even towards my ears. Basically, it seems just as loud to someone else in the room with me as it does to me, which then begs the question of why not just use an external speaker at that point? The call quality was just OK as well. The one thing I can say is that the build quality seems quite good. It feels really durable and made with premium feeling materials. But I just can't shake the feeling that for the asking price, I'm missing the point of these. Shouldn't the speakers be facing upwards towards my ears instead of blasting at each other in front of my Adam's Apple? Seems like a weird design that might be missing the mark.",positive,negative

B08TKXDLQB,5.0,"I love this tv, it is definitely a masterpiece! Very well made and fantastic quality.

Slim feet that slide into place with no tools- only have ONE configuration. 2 USBs, 4 HDMIs, Ethernet, optical & headphone outputs, & a mini a/v input. Operating system is Google Tv which works smoothly and has lots of apps built in. Works with Google Home and Alexa.<br /><br />Has some intrusive ads on the homepage. You can go into the settings/privacy/ ads to opt out of personalized ads though. You can use your remote microphone to do voice commands on the tv. It also has the nice shortcut buttons for Youtube, Netflix, Disney+, and Prime Video.<br /><br />Sound has tweeters on the side. It upscales the audio to give you a surround sound effect. Acoustic auto calibration which when you go to your sitting area with the remote and start this- it sends these crazy alien laser blaster sounds out of the speakers for a couple seconds and your remote reads them so the tv can process the information and adjust your speakers accordingly. It will then adjust the speakers so it sends sound to where you're sitting to give you the best experience possible!<br /><br />The cognitive processor in this puts more emphasis into the areas of the picture that you'll be focused on- definitely makes a noticeable difference!<br /><br />XR TRILUMINOS PRO technology gives you better color accuracy and depth.<br /><br />XR Contrast booster gives you better contrast.<br /><br />Very deep blacks with very little light blooming (meaning it has very even brightness across the screen.) The screen has PLENTY of brightness, that is definitely not an issue with this tv!<br /><br />Ambient optimization option which changes your screen based on the ambient lighting in the room. Controls brightness and color tones. There are settings to optimize the screen for Netflix, Imax, Cinema, Etc that are amazing!<br /><br />Motion is great, it has 120 hertz which keeps up with the action very well! You can adjust the Motionflow settings to your custom settings or just set it to auto and let it do it's thing.<br /><br />Comparing it to the other top Sony models:<br />If you're on a budget and this is on the higher end of that, you might look into the Sony X80J- it's also a 2021 model and is 4k Ultra HD. It's not quite as nice of a picture as this Full Array but it's still a great tv! Otherwise if you can swing it- this X90J Full Array is definitely a fantastic choice! If your budget can STILL swing more though, you might even look into the X90J OLED tv, it's picture pops even more than this Full Array. Whatever your choice, you'll love any of them! I have all 3 models and we absolutely love each and every one of them- the X80 and X90 line are just fantastic tvs at a really fair price point.",positive,positive

B00C8FDKRU,3.0,"Most people are raving about this camera because they are using it with their iPhones.<br /><br />But if you don't have an iPhone, keep looking, there are other kits that will be more to your liking.  Because of my lack of an iPhone (oddly, I just got one two days ago, so I may give this another try and then update the review if I like the camera more) I had to use the included link to the executable Windows program.  The program is outdated (like from the days of VCR's and answering machines) and has no documentation.<br /><br />By documentation, I mean there are minimal instructions and no built in help files.  I was able to get it to work by running the software with a lot of finagling and figuring it out by means of hunting around through my past experiences hooking up cameras.<br /><br />All in all, a bit of a disappointment, I was hoping to catch the wankers who keep spraypainting my carport.<br /><br />Update - Still using this with the PC, just a note, you have to leave the PC software running to report. This camera works through an extension cord but not a surge protector.  Not sure of what the range is and at least in our house, it needed to be on the same circuit breaker as the base, but this could just be weird wiring in our house.<br /><br />A nice feature of the camera is a motion detection feature, so you don't end up with hours of blank unmoving street view for example.  For the recording, pretty much continuously, it takes about 2GB per night (this is with camera on from about 9pm to 8am).  There is a way to look at the recorded footage in super fast motion, so it takes about five minutes to watch the entire night's events (use VLC);'oh, hello again, curious kitty who keeps hanging out on my porch.'<br /><br />This is not an outdoor camera, but we are using it outdoors anyways (tried placing it near a window, but glare of light on the window blinded the camera).  I don't have any need to record stuff indoors.  Because of the camera we caught a strange creepy person coming up to our house while we were out yesterday, they also visited the houses of two of our neighbors.  If not for the camera we wouldn't have known about this.  There are a lot of strange characters in our neighborhood and there have been a few incidents; nothing major, a crazy woman tried to break in while we were eating dinner, a man with dementia was wandering around our bridge, kids stealing wood from our woodpile, you know, ordinary disturbances, so this person was exactly what we wanted to see while we weren't home.<br /><br />The software allows for up to nine cameras to be in use, I can't even imagine that, but it might be cool to have another to watch our backyard, we might be able to catch the raccoons or the river otter who we've only gotten fleeting glimpses of.",positive,negative

It's not an extremely expensive hi-fi unit, eben thou it says it is hi-fi, but for the price the sound quality should a lot better. It's like listening to an am radio station that goes in and out of range. The tuning is not a simple selector switch, but instead it uses a scroll wheel located right by the volume scroll wheel. I'm not sure what genius thought that was a smart location for it, because on a few a occasions I've changed the tuning by mistake. if your TV is like mine with an aux cord out, and no sound system, than you might run into the issue where the TV won't play through its own speakers when the unit is plugged in and your using it. This may be an issue if you wanted to use it as a audio booster if you are hard of hearing and want a separate volume control from that of the TV's speakers. Overall it was just poor experience with the unit. I usually love Sennheiser products, and they used to be made very well, I believe there high end is still that way. but like every company these days they sacrifice a lot trying to cheapen themselves to a price point that everyone can afford.",negative,negative

I really like the 'sleep' feature that this cover has, putting my Kindle to sleep mode when I close the cover, something I haven't come across in the other covers I've bought in the past.  It does have a handy stand feature that lets you prop it up, in the horizontal position only.  The fasteners to hold the cover closed and to keep the Kindle in place inside are rubber, but they do a decent job of it (and can be positioned to prevent any important ports/buttons from being covered). Of course, with this type of cover (fake leather, going for the appearance of a real journal/book), the speakers are going to be covered, but it doesn't have too much impact on the sound when you're using it.<br /><br />There's been comments made on the smell of this cover, and I've noticed that pretty much all of my fake leather covers come with some sort of odor when they arrive.  It usually dissipates after a day or two (longest might have lasted a week) and this was no exception - if anything, this was one of the 'better' smelling faux leather covers I've received.  None of them were so awful as to be off-putting, in my opinion, but I'm aware that it's a personal thing, how much it affects you.<br /><br />All in all, this is an impressive looking cover that has a few nice features and enough heft to provide some decent protection for your Kindle Fire.",positive,positive

B08B3G74MY,3.0,"Great sound,  noise cancelation, and look. Other than that, another company purchased jaybird, and they stopped updating the software for the earbuds and case.

B07GW74B6N,4.0,"Super thin, huge 17"" touch screen with colors that just POP, large touchpad mouse, and silent chiclet keyboard.  These are just the initial impressions one would see at first blush when approaching this high-quality laptop.  Look a little deeper and one would find that this Dell XPS 17 sports a powerful 11th generation I7-11800H cpu with a dedicated RTX 3050 graphics card with Nvidia's real-time ray tracing and 16gb of ram.  A 512GB ssd rounds out the entire package.<br /><br />The Dell XPS 17 is simply elegant and high-quality.  I was able to upgrade this laptop to Windows 11 painlessly and the new UI just looks great on this screen.  It runs silently during normal web browsing and video watching.  When playing games, the fan kicks in and the cooling seems adequate, but I still have an external laptop cooler helping it along.<br /><br />Speaking of games, this laptop will run the latest games, but being at the bottom of the RTX line of graphics cards, the screen's 3840x2400 resolution simply is too much for the 3050 to run at the highest quality.  It means that one would either run at a lower resolution or lower quality.  The resolution issue can be alleviated if one turns on DLSS for resolution scaling.<br /><br />So that is one of the first problems I would point out with the specs that I have in this laptop.  The RTX3050 paired with the super high resolution means one must compromise in some way.  In addition, performance in VR is somewhat poor.  Half Life: Alyx runs well at low quality settings but any higher and the screen stutters and can cause nausea -- this was tested through wired and wireless configurations.<br /><br />The second complaint that I have for this laptop is that the only included ports are 4 usb Type-C ports, headphone jack and an SD card reader.  It is great that the ports support up to Thunderbolt 3, but the fact that no Type-A ports are available, dongles will be a part of life.  It's nice that Dell includes a dongle that sports an HDMI and a Type-A port, there is no ethernet or display port support out of the box.<br /><br />A good 9-in-1 dongle will cost you at least $60 and even then, the quality could be questionable.  I happened to have a 9-in-1 dongle, but the ethernet port seems to lose connection constantly.  This means that either you take a chance with a $60 no-name dongle or you spend over $100 for a proven one.<br /><br />This then brings me to the last problem that I want to point out.  A gaming PC has very high power requirements.  Currently, there is no Type-C product that will provide (or pass through) the 130W that the Dell XPS 17 will require.  It means that the nifty dock that you bought to get the additional ports that you need?  It won't be able to power the laptop.  You can connect a 100W charger to the laptop, but you will get a warning from the operating system.  So perhaps on travel, one can get away with trickle charging the laptop, but at home, you will always be stuck with taking up two ports, one for power and one for your monitor.<br /><br />Overall, this is a GREAT laptop with high quality build, but at the current specs, some things just cause awkward situations that one needs to work around.",positive,negative

Then I unscrewed them from that table and gently placed them under it until the next week when I would use them again.

B07H9B8MDS,2.0,"I would give this one star, except for the cheap price.  The number one problem with mine is that the heart rate monitor does not accurately measure heart rate, or even close.  After 15-20 minutes of running, the readings fluctuated wildly.  At first it was 120, then 131, then a few seconds later 85!  I tried looser and tighter band settings, and also tried rotating the watch to position the sensor on different areas of my wrist (to detect pulse better), and it still never worked correctly.  I'm not sure if mine is just defective, or this product is poorly designed.  There are also a few other minor issues, such as the dull screen (see photo - very hard to read when outdoors) and also my device has randomly shut off a few times.  Overall, I would not recommend this product for anyone.  It's too bad, though, because the design is nice (as is the price) and the bluetooth connectivity and software work well.",negative,negative

B094CLC7WK,3.0,"I went on the search for a set of ear buds that would stay in my ears better than my Airpod Pros but with the same level of Noise cancellation. It seemed like the Sony WF-1000XM4 and Bose Quietcomfort earbuds were the top picks in this space. After a lot of research i went with the Sony earbuds. Besides their sound and level of ANC. i liked the fact the Sony earbuds still had a lot of playback control available from the earbuds and you can use either earbud individually. I also felt like the fact that they sit in your ear canal rather than on the outside would contribute to the noise cancellation.<br /><br />The earbuds felt and sound good and the accompanying app was nice but the case had a cheap, almost cardboard feel. My main issues were, although the earbuds never actually fell out of my ear, I think their top-heavy design made them feel like they were always about to fall out. The bigger issue i had, which won't apply to everyone, is how much effort went into getting them to sit correctly in my ear. Even with twisting, and pushing, I could never get the right earbud to fit securely in my ear like the left one did.<br /><br />After a day of wearing the Sonys i decided to pick up a pair of Bose Quietcomfort ear buds as i already had a pair of Quietcomfort 35 over the ears that i loved, i figured I'd give Bose another shot. As soon as i opened the Bose, I immediately fell in love. Besides the unboxing and charging case feeling more premium, the earbuds went into my ear effortlessly and securely. I wore them the first day and they stayed in place all day and sounded great.<br /><br />Although the Sony WF-1000XM4 is a great set of earbuds, The Bose earbuds have the same functionality, sound and ANC but are designed in a way to comfortably fit a wider array of ear shapes and at a cheaper price. The Sonys are going back and the Bose are going to be my new day-to-day earbuds.",positive,positive

B01DJ3S1A0,4.0,"I received this as a free review sample. I subtracted a star because in small quarters the fan can get irritating, and also the picture area is a little skewed. The latter is not enough to ruin a video, but combined with the fan noise I felt that this falls into the four star category. To be fair, this is about on par with other portable projectors in this price range and sharing the general form factor.<br /><br />On the plus side, this is an inexpensive way to get a large screen TV (assuming that your wall is the screen), that does a credible job of projecting movies, TV and presentations.  I tested it using a Chromecast and streaming video from YouTube to my phone, then casting from my phone to the Chromecast dongle connected to one of the HDMI ports in the rear. No issues and it was actually a treat. I also tested it with an old Roku in an HDMI port streaming a movie from Netflix. To be sure, neither experience compares to my HD TV screen and surround sound system, but this does not come close to the price tags of those. Bang for the buck this is excellent if you are in a budget.<br /><br />Frankly, I did not test the other ports, but do want to point out that the 'SD' card port is really USB A that will take a flash drive or an SD card using an adapter. Actually, I think that is a plus as well because flash drives are cheap and a 32GB one can hold a respectable amount of movies, home videos or presentations.<br /><br />Sound quality is not spectacular, but is definitely adequate.  Overall, this is as good as any projector among the four that I have either owned or tested, and is better than some. It would easily be a five star projector if it had a quieter fan. If you can live with that you will probably love it.",positive,positive

B002GYWHSQ,4.0,"I have had the latest gen Kindle DX since October 2010.  I am a singer in a choir and use it to display my sheet music.  It is well suited to my needs.  The display is clear and crisp and is the size of a standard music hymnal.  The catch is getting the music onto the device.  Most publishers are starting to provide PDF versions of at least melody with accompaniment.  However, being an alto in a choir, that isn't sufficient.  I need the 3 or 4 part choral version.  Also, it is formatted for an 8.5 x 11 inch page with headers, footers, and page numbers.  I only need the music staff and lyrics.  So I do it the hard way.  I scan my (purchased & owned) hymnal or sheet music, crop it down to what I need, then convert it to a PDF.  Lots of work, but the payoff is worth it.  I no longer carry around 100+ lbs of sheet music and hymnals twice a week!  Keep in mind this isn't for everyone.  It requires a lot of time and patience, but once the music has been prepped and imported, it's done and ready when you need it.  I assume after a year I'll have perhaps 80% of my library scanned.  Then I'll only need 5-10 minutes each week to add the relevant music to a collection for quick access.<br /><br />I also use the Kindle not so much for reading, but for listening.  I love the text-to-speech feature.  I use it for casual reading as well as my Cisco tech books.  Funky digital voice and some unusual phrasing and pronunciation, but you can't beat having it read to you while your hands and eyes are otherwise engaged in other things such as driving or crocheting :D<br /><br />I have used the web feature while camping.  Nothing great, but you can check email, news, Facebook and other text or mobile supported sites.  I've also used it when traveling to get directions or check Yelp while on the go.  Since I don't have a smart phone this is actually a huge plus!  One thing to keep in mind is that image intensive sites may crash the Kindle (due to lack of memory) and you will have to reload it to clear the issue.<br /><br />The music player is lacking, but for an e-reader, I guess that's expected.  You can load music and it will play in the order you loaded it.  You can pause and skip, but that's about it.  No actual controls or playlist features.<br /><br />One major feature that is currently lacking is hands free page turning.  Since there is no USB driver or bluetooth support, I don't foresee this ever being available, but it is definitely something to keep in mind.  I also play flute and am unable to use the Kindle to display my flute music unless it is a single page.<br /><br />So, for my needs, it's great.  However, if you're looking for more media support or better web access, you should look elsewhere.",positive,negative

I thought I was listening to a different album!  The rubber ring fitted snuggly in my ears and it meant it did reduce the external background noise so I didn't to have the volume as loud.  There are other sized rubber rings to fit your earhole.  The Audi was definitely a lot sharper and clearer.  I also played joss stone and the voice was crisper.

Sometimes she had to touch them 5x before they registered to pause the music, which made her more likely to pull out the player and pause it there instead.<br />I'd say these are 4 star headphones except for that selling point failure, if you are buying these because of the touch controls, I'd have to reduce the score to 3.",positive,negative

I like to think I'm a pretty smart guy, and I couldnt figure it out without reading the instructions. A product that requires reading the manual for full operation is a badly designed product. Just look at apple. They don't make a product that a 5 year old couldn't pick up and use. As much as I disagree with them as a company, they've set the bar for product usability, and at this price point I expect nothing less.<br /><br />A $350 pair of headphones in 2019 that has little more in the way of user comforts than a $50 pair is kind of sad.",positive,negative

B003BT6BM8,5.0,"I had been looking for earbuds that wouldn't continually fall out of my ears and started researching here on Amazon and was immediately drawn to these ""earhook"" headphones.

I would have thought that after wearing them for a while, they would start to feel heavy wrapped around my ears but they don't!  I just love the fact that I can wear them on my walks and while running around town and not have to worry about my earbuds falling out every few minutes.  The sound quality is very good and it blocks out other noises because they fit (and stay) in your ears so well.

Thank God someone's out there to protect us in at least small ways from the problems created by the engineered obsolescence that is putting us in debt almost as much as healthcare costs.<br /><br />Here's a hint, Apple and other tech companies. Weight isn't the only factor in portability. Anything gained in that area by the thin profile of this MacBook is lost because it's necessary to carry two or three little cables with me. The more pieces I have to cart, the greater the chance something will get lost. I feel the same way about eliminating DVD drives. Not EVERYTHING is on the Web, and free Net access isn't available EVERYWHERE.

B07KMFGBFF,5.0,"It's ""almost"" (see my edit below) impossible to find a negative review of the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x Closed Back Headphones. And I have to agree.  Probably the best headphones I've ever owned.  They've been available now for 10 or so years. You can't get this high end quality audio anywhere else for this price point.  I got an excellent deal because I came across an Amazon seller, The Blucoil Store, who also included 3 high quality extra items for just about the same price as the headphones alone.  My package included an extra cable, a solid hard plastic carrying case, and a FiiO A1 headphone amplifier.<br />The headphones live up to all the positive reviews, and the extras included made for a very good total price.<br />I would definitely recommend this product.<br />Updated 2/4/2021, 4 months later.<br />I still love these headphones.  I have to laugh when I occasionally check the customer reviews and find that most of the criticisms are based on how these headphones were purposely engineered.  Let me be more specific.  Some of the negative comments include:<br />-others around you can hear what you're listening to. Oh well.  Too bad. They should probably put on their own noise cancelling headphones.  Which brings me to my next point:<br />-they're not noise cancelling.  Yup, that's right.  When I did my search for headphones, I specifically did NOT want noise cancelling OR wireless. Much prefer putting the money saved when not buying these options and putting it toward better cans.<br />-there is no microphone on the cables.  Correct again.  These headphones were not necessarily intended for those who want a set of cans primarily to support their cell phone addiction.<br />-they must be used with the company's proprietary cables to attach to the headphones.  I'll take that and love it.  Why?  Because they twist and lock into the bottom of the can.  How many times, with other headphones, have I moved too far, or stood up or whatever, and the cord would be ripped out of the cans!!<br />-too much bass, not enough base. Midrange too pronounced, or not enough.  And they go on and on and on.<br />-the ""best"" (tongue in cheek) criticism stated that none of the included cables + the included adapters fit their computer.  I don't know what kind of a computer this person has, but, well...you get the idea.<br />-and finally, and I quote, ""I needed to add an EQ to make them sound like I wanted them to"".  Precisely! These cans are marketed for those who are looking for an accurate, unadulterated representation of the original recording.  The way the musicians and the recording engineers intended it to sound.  If one doesn't find that acceptable, and that's fine, include an EQ somewhere in the mix.  As a matter of fact, I have more than my share of sound shaping hardware and software all over my system in order to taylor the music to my liking.<br />You need to like how the sound is reproduced, and this is very subjective.  One person's likes are another person's hates, especially when it comes from those who love to sound like they ""might"" know what they are talking about..  I bought and returned a number of headphones because I didn't care for how they sounded.  I kept these.<br />I do agree with one common complaint.  The earpads do get uncomfortable after a while.  I checked for aftermarket replacements, but many included their own negative reviews that they changed the sound quality from the originals. That's the last thing I want.<br />In my (very judgmental) opinion, you can't go wrong with these!",positive,negative
B076VN7GYR,4.0,"[[VIDEOID:baa62f01c58e825d0c7953ba708980ee]] I can now without our jog without having to worry about my airpods or earbuds from falling out of my ears and losing then. Although this was probably designed for apple airpods which are a bit slimmer than off brand ones, I did manage to get them into my regular earpods I use as well. It's nice that they were two cables on the box. The silicone rubbery feels make it harder to slip off my neck, which is something I like as well. My only dislike is that I have to slide them on and off in order for me to charge the earbuds back into the case. I wish they were more like a clip on do I would have easier access to put the silicone on now quickly. Material isa bit cheap compared to others straps I have used on the past and does not have magnetic clips to click the together.",positive,negative
B00UPKMVCU,3.0,"Lets start by defining what this set is and is not: it is a set of devices that are designed to be aesthetically pleasing.  It is designed to be minimalist.  It is not designed to be ergonomic.<br /><br />I liken the keyboard to the apple wireless keyboard; keys feel like a laptop and you can't adjust the angle of the keyboard unless you stack up stuff under the back of the keyboard.<br /><br />I do like the design of these.  They are good looking devices and have an interesting magnetic battery compartment.  If sleek and minimalist is what you are going for in your work space, these fit the bill.<br /><br />These devices are plastic.  I don't find this to be a major drawback, but some might have issues with it.<br /><br />I have already stated, this set is not ergonomic.  The mouse is especially awkward to use (unless you like the generally flat styles mouses like the apple magic mouse).  My everyday mouse is the Microsoft Arc mouse (the older hinged one, not the one that bends).  If you like the programmable back button on your mouse, you will find that you miss it on the microsoft designer set.<br /><br />Pairing is where most people seem to have the biggest problem with this set.  I also had issues.  I am running Win 7 64 bit and have bluetooth on the computer.  I had the most current BT4.0 drivers, but still ended up having to check the manufacturer's driver site for an additional driver.  Even after installing a new driver, I was only able to get the keyboard to work consistently.  The keyboard seems to work well and even when I start up my computer.  The mouse, on the other hand, was less forgiving.  No matter what I did, I could only SOMETIMES get the mouse to correctly pair.  The computer could see it, but it wouldn't save the device or even stay connected after the pairing was complete.  I am sure with more noodling around, I could probably get it connected, but for me, it isn't really worth it (I like my old Arc Mouse better).  I bought the set with the intent of using just the keyboard, so it was not really a huge issue for me.<br /><br />It seems that this set is intended for devices that use with Windows 8 or above, so keep that in mind when purchasing.  I am using 7 and it generally works, but it is going to be most dependent on the Bluetooth drivers you have installed.<br /><br />Pro-Tip:  Look for used sets.  A lot of people buy this keyboard thinking it will be easy to set up, then return it when they realize that you need bluetooth on your computer or you will have to buy a dongle.  Currently, there are sets that are like new at 30% the suggested retail (half what they are actually selling for).  Buy from Warehouse deals and the purchase is guaranteed by amazon (just like any new item that is sold by amazon).  I think the deals that can be had on this set make it worth while for someone who is looking to try out the set, but not sure if it will play nice or if they will even like it.",positive,negative

B00L23XFNS,5.0,"Not being a techie, I am never too good at figuring out electronics. These headphones were fairly easy, however. They do come charged, which is very helpful. The instructions were very easy to understand. The charging wire is just the USB cable, in order to plug it into a computer. If charging from a wall outlet is desired, it is necessary to use the adapter from a cellphone or other device, not a real problem. The Bluetooth paired easily with my phone, but had more issue with a tablet. The headphones just recognized the phone and the light indicated that it was connected. I had to take the phone more than 30 feet away before the headset was in &#34;pairing&#34; mode. But then the Bluetooth worked fine. Mind you, I said I am not a techie. The sound is fine, as I am not into loud music in my head, I had to turn it down. It is necessary to remove the headphones to adjust the volume buttons, at least it is for me.

B08NJZW9Q6,4.0,"Some of my devices lack really nice speakers, so I like to have a speaker handy so that I can listen to music or presentations as I go about my day.  Let's take a look at this one.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This speaker comes in a foam liner inside a sturdy gift appropriate box.  It has an audio 3.5 cord as well as a Type C charging cord with USB at the other end.  It has a carry handle on it too.  There is a basic instruction manual in a variety of languages.<br /><br />BLUETOOTH<br />The connections are usually pretty stable, but once in a while depending on the device, we have to remove the speaker and reboot the device and speaker to get it to line up again even if it has already been connected previously with no issues.<br /><br />SOUND<br />The sound of this speaker is surprisingly fantastic.  It depends on the source recording, of course, but in most cases, I have to say that the sound of this little guy is really great.  The top however, does move in and out so you can not block it or put anything on top of it or it can break the speaker.<br /><br />MICRO SD CARD SLOT<br />I have to be honest here.  I can not get the Micro SD slot to work correctly.  I have tried many times to get it to play, but it won't.  The directions say that you can hit the mode button and it will get to the micro SD card mode but it just sits and goes back to blutooth mode again.  I am not sure why this is happening.  The same card plays on other devices just fine so I know it is not the card.<br /><br />AUDIO<br />I have also not been able to get my audio cord to work but I think that is because my old MP3 player I was testing it with was not working correctly and that is the only device I would use with that feature of this speaker.<br /><br />CALLS<br />I don't use this with my phone so I don't answer calls with it.<br /><br />CHARGE<br />A charge generally lasts me about 10 hours or so, depending on usage periods and how spread out they are. It takes between 1 and 2 hours to recharge.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great small speaker.  It is waterproof (I did not test that aspect at this point) and sounds great.  The MicroSD slot has not worked for me yet, but otherwise it is a good speaker.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  I like this but wish that the other features worked a bit more easily.  I will update if I find solutions to the issues I have been having.",positive,negative

The new system is very slow when we open up apps like YouTube and Twitch, so much so that my household has been using our old Google Chromecast for those tasks instead.

The bass is pleasingly present, deep, tight, and well defined. The mid and high end frequencies are very clear. While this system may not be meant to play very loud, it does fill a room nicely.

B00HO5JE3I,5.0,"At first glance the Asus VivoBook V551LA-DS17T appears to be a nice touch-screen UltraBook-class computer, but it is a few steps beyond a typical UltraBook. Combining features of UltraBook systems and multimedia/entertainment workstations, this computer is what new systems ought to be. There are a couple of design decisions I would change and it's by no means a high-end gaming rig, but Asus got the important things right.<br /><br />There are two things that set this system apart from a normal UltraBook. First is the inclusion of a slimline CD/DVD R/W drive. I have seen no other UltraBooks out there that include one, so finding one in this system was a very pleasant surprise. Carrying an external CD/DVD drive around can be inconvenient (especially when traveling) so having a built-in drive is a huge plus. Asus managed to include this drive in the system while still keeping the system to roughly an inch thick. The other differentiating factor that makes this system different than other UltraBooks I have seen (and not in a positive way) is the weight. This is a particularly heavy system and will make toting it around a chore.<br /><br />I booted up the system and configured it for use and immediately went about looking for the utility for making recovery/restore DVD media. After searching the file system and the installed program list with no success I finally resorted to calling technical support. I spoke to a charming young lady who was exceptionally helpful and got me on my way to creating a recovery USB drive. So, from that experience I can say that technical support is courteous and helpful. However, I never did figure out how to make DVD media, but at least I can restore the system now should I have a need to do so.<br /><br />After power-on for the first time it performed a bunch of hands-off updates and when it finished and finally allowed interaction with the OS it was loaded with Windows 8.1; it wasn't obvious if the initial OS install was 8 or 8.1 but that is irrelevant - 8.1 is what is there when the user can finally begin exploring the system. I spent a little time digging through the list of installed applications and was pleased to see that Asus did not load this system up with excessive bloatware. There are several applications I do not need and I intend to remove them - MS Office and McAfee protection services being among them - but at least what is there is not unreasonable. Interestingly, most new systems I have used have come with 1-2 years of internet security protection, but this system comes with just 30 days.<br /><br />One design decision that really surprised me is that this system does not include a solid-state drive (SSD). I understand the reason - it drives up cost - but to me having an SSD in this system would make it even faster and make the battery last longer. This is by no means a deal-breaker but bootup times are slower as a result.<br /><br />Asus makes a big deal about the touch screen on this system and touts it as more sensitive than most other touch screens. Asus' claims appear to be well-founded as the other touch screen systems available to me are nowhere near as responsive. After spending a couple of hours working with this system I unplugged my trackball and I don't think I will need it again for this particular system. If you are buying this system for the ability to use the touch screen, you will be pleased.<br /><br />Battery life so far is excellent. I charged the system up completely and spent a good three hours using it for web surfing and typing up documents and the battery still maintains more than half of its charge. I plan to load up my development environment and see how the battery holds up under load, and I expect that to make the battery drain faster, but for typical use (surfing the web, writing document and watching online videos) the battery seems to be very much in the game.<br /><br />The graphics system is provided by the Intel chipset and it is acceptable for most uses. It's not high end graphics but it's not terrible either. Serious gamers will not appreciate this system whereas most casual gamers and people using the system for more business-types of functions will be more than satisfied. As an experiment I had my teenage son load up Minecraft (an online game that uses 1st-person perspective) and test the graphics. He noticed that while the game played well enough it is not quite as smooth as a system that has a dedicated graphics card.<br /><br />Wi-Fi connection speed seems to be about average with other wireless-n devices on the network.<br /><br />One thing that really startled me is the quality of the sound system. Asus says that this is the best configuration for embedded sound available and I found the sound quality coming from the embedded speakers to be more than acceptable. The speakers are on the bottom of the unit and are visible via two inch-long slits in the case. In spite of the small aperture, the output is very good, better than one would expect.<br /><br />With the slimline DVD and the decent sound quality, paired with the i7 processor and 8GB RAM this system is well-suited for multimedia tasks such as video production and music creation. It has the horsepower to handle the renders and so far has performed well while working on either audio or video composition. As I mentioned above I expect these types of activities to take more battery than less strenuous tasks but I have not spent enough time with these types of applications on this system yet to determine just how much they will impact battery life.<br /><br />The touch pad is a bit better than average and is placed well. One issue I have with most laptops is that I tend to tap the touch pad while typing and on occasion I can highlight and delete a whole section of text unintentionally. So far this has not been a problem with this system and I think it has a lot to do with the way the touch pad is positioned relative to the open space on the keyboard. Asus includes a very nice utility (accessible by a special key on the keyboard) that makes turning the touch pad on and off very simple, so it's easy to eliminate any issue with it if it's ""in the way"" while typing.<br /><br />The power adapter is odd and I am not sure I like it. The shape requires a little planning as it is a square block pressed against the wall when it is plugged in. Most adapters typically have the brick in the middle. So, plugging this adapter in when working in a cramped space could potentially pose a challenge. Another observation - the adapter gets rather warm.<br /><br />I do not like the way the hard drive is partitioned right out of the box. It appears that the drive was simply chopped into two roughly equal partitions, the D: drive labeled as ""data"". I would rather have one large drive, instead of two smaller ones. This is a personal preference though and I am sure most will be indifferent.<br /><br />I decided to toss in a Linux LiveCD and boot it up to see how well supported the touch screen is with a current distribution. The system refused to boot from it initially; to get it to boot I had to turn off Secure Boot in the BIOS after which I was able to boot up from the DVD. My distribution of choice for this experiment was Mint 16 with the Cinnamon Desktop. I found that there is basic support in place for the screen, though only as a standard pointing device (a lot like using a Wacom tablet) and not as a swipe and gesture interface. There are other distributions out now that are geared more towards tablets; I will try one of those and see how well it works out. That said, the fact that the desktop at least recognizes the screen as a pointing device and properly responds to it is a good thing.<br /><br />A few other technical details: The system has 3 USB ports (two of them USB 3.0 and one of them USB 2.0), an HDMI port, an Ethernet port (which is not a given anymore when it comes to notebook computers), an audio out and a SD card reader. Given a choice I would have liked to have a VGA or DVI port to put the display on a second screen but that's not something I have seen on the most recent systems.<br /><br />Asus has put together a very nice UltraBook-like system in this notebook. It's a nice workhorse for most uses and the touch screen is absolutely wonderful. The system's a bit hefty though and might prove to be cumbersome for those on the go, and the graphics system is not at serious gaming level, but the system is a solid performer and provides the best features of an UltraBook and a multimedia workstations in one place.",positive,negative

B07MLY3JKV,5.0,"Why are they not available now? It’s a great device!!! I’m not a ‘tech’ person at all! I’m a single female that’s 65 years old and have problems with almost all of these things EXCEPT for this one! This is a small, handy ‘plug’ with a mini speaker - great for a relatively unused room. I have mine in my 3rd spare bedroom that I use for my ironing board, drying rack, etc. I’m home alone just about every day and I have music playing from the time I get up in the morning till I fall asleep at night and with this I can now hear it while I’m doing my laundry chores. The sound quality isn’t great but acceptable for its purpose and Alexa responds quickly and very well with my voice commands, whether it’s music related or something else! I like that it’s both a small plug and has some of the capabilities of an Echo Dot, Show, and the other larger Smart devices. I can also use the USB port and normal, non ‘smart’ outlet. The cost was minimal and I’m really bummed that I can’t buy this anymore! I only started using ‘smart’ things several months ago and now I’m slowly adding more and more.

B00H899CLO,5.0,"I received a review sample of this cord and charger combination and have been testing it thoroughly. The most striking feature is the three meter cable, which is the longest I have seen for any iPhone (or Android phone for that matter.)<br /><br />My first inclination was to test the cable for failures because the length seemed excessive. It performed every data transfer and synching operation flawlessly. It also fast-charges like an Apple OEM cable. I was a bit surprised that this and the charger were not MFi certified (Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad). Other cables and chargers that I have received from the manufacturer were, but this is indistinguishable from the MFi and Apple OEM cables that I have tested - both visually and from a performance perspective.<br /><br />The contacts on both the USB and Lightning connector ends are precision made and mate perfectly to the ports to which they were designed to connect. The outer jacket is thick, but not too stiff to make handling it a problem. There are strain reliefs on both ends to ensure a long service life.<br /><br />This set includes a bonus wall charger with folding prongs. This has the same well made construction, and also puts out a steady 2.1A for fast charging. This charger is perfect for iPads too because of the output rating. If I had one wish it would have a second 1.0A port for those of us who want to simultaneously charge a phone and tablet - perhaps the next generation of this product will have that feature.<br /><br />Bottom line: when size (in the form of cable length) matters this is one of the very few on the market that is a full three meters long. Add in the fact that this one is made to perform like an Apple OEM cable and the value should be apparent.",positive,negative

If you're going to buy this case BUY IT NOW!<br /><br />Firstly, I just want to say if you want to SEE my PC check out the last 3 customer uploaded images, they are of my newly built PC in this case. If you can't find customer images, go to the main product page for this case, and click ""See all 5 customer images"", it's right under the picture of the case.<br /><br />My current specs:<br />CPU: AMD FX 8320 (3.5GHZ stock) Overclocked @ 4.22 GHZ<br />CPU Cooling: Corsair H80 High Performance Liquid Cooling System<br />Motherboard: Gigabyte FX 990 UD3 AM3+<br />Power Supply: Rosewill Capstone 750W 80+ Gold certified.<br />SSD: Sandisk 32GB (I just use it for my operating system for quick bootups, nothing else.)<br />HD: Seagate Barracuda 1TB 64MB cache 7200 RPM SATA III<br />Graphics: Geforce 760 GTX 4GB 256bit GDDR5 (When I was deciding whether or not to order this case, this was my biggest concern, ""Will one of the new big geforce graphics cards fit?"" - YES it will! I MIGHT be able to fit another one in, but I really don't need another one, the 760 is a beast!)<br />Ram: 16GB Gskill Sniper Series DDR3 2400<br /><br />Whew, now having said all that, EVERYTHING fits in this case. Is it a little bit snug? See for yourself, I don't think so, but some might. I also got a non-modular power supply so that adds alot of unnecessary cables.<br /><br />The fact is though, my computer does NOT overheat. I monitor temps whenever my computer is on (with CPUID, free program!) and as an example, under a full load my CPU temp stays ~20C and my GPU can get up to ~60C on a warm day. Keep in mind though for the CPU I'm using a $104 liquid cooling system (I just happened to get a GREAT deal on it).<br /><br />The see-through case is pretty cool too, I like being able to see the components plus with a liquid cooling system if any liquid starts leaking I can immediately take care of it, although I highly doubt it will leak.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope this review helps, keep in mind I put alot of stuff in here with the 4 ram modules, and the pretty large graphics card (the Geforce 760 GTX is about 11.5"" long, it's pretty big), but it does all fit!<br /><br />Keep in mind this is a ~$50 case. For $50 it is a good deal, if you want a ""better"" case, you're going to have to spend more money it's as simple as that. People nitpick things like a flimsy backplate, or not having the best cable management, well the more you expect from a product the more you're going to end up paying for it. So take it easy on a $50 case.<br /><br />I can say for sure it's better than my old HP desktop PC computer case. It actually FEELS like a gamer's case.<br /><br />So all-in-all, if you're on a budget and looking for a nice computer case for $50 I recommend this case. It's got everything I needed and it's got everything 90% of people will need or care about. I'd buy it again.",positive,negative
B00SSNIKV2,5.0,"I have a 10"" tablet and it primarily gets used as an e-reader and as a music streaming device. It's a great device and I love it, but I do get frustrated with figuring out where to put it when I am streaming music through it. Although it is a relatively small device it does take up some room on the desk when in a stand case. I have tried suction mounts to attach it to a window and that works fine but the window cannot move and when the window is cold the suction mount lets go. This flexible mount for tablets is a very good solution for my needs and is far better constructed than suggested by the product description.<br /><br />This is a simple mount in concept and design. It is flexible coil tube with a screw-on vice clamp attached on one end and an adjustable frame-style bracket attached via a ball joint to the other. In the box the unit comes unassembled and requires less than two minutes to put together. When finished, the whole thing is approximately 3' long.<br /><br />Everything about this mounting stand suggests that it is built to last and is designed to hold up under heavy use. The coil tube is about the heaviest I have ever seen: it is roughly a half inch in diameter and is exceptionally stiff which makes it well suited for supporting the weight of the tablet. The item description here says it will support 2.2 pounds but it will support a little more than that (though I would not try to put much extra on there, particularly if the coil is horizontal).<br /><br />The coil attaches to the vice clamp via a threaded machine screw assembly and it has enough threading to allow the coil to turn 360 degrees without becoming detached. This allows the tablet to be swung around a work area in an arch without having to really do anything that requires any effort. While this is great, what really caught my attention is that the clamp itself can be screwed to the coil in two ways at 90-degree angles (top or side) so that the clamp can be attached to an anchored surface that is either horizontal or vertical. This is one of those design decisions that just makes sense but I have seen very few manufacturers make this kind of effort.<br /><br />The coil is covered by a very heavy plastic sleeve which protects the tube and makes flexing the tube easier on the hands.<br /><br />The mounting bracket is connected to the top of the flexible tube by a ball joint, similar to the kind of joints many GPS navigators use in cars to attach to the suction base. When I first attached the bracket to the coil I put it on upside down, which is not a big deal except that the weight of the tablet worked against the joint and it tilted downward slightly. The bracket itself is a standard slider with a lever that presses against the slider which then catches on teeth on the frame to lock it in place. There's a fair bit of padding on the bracket to protect the tablet when it's being clamped in and when the position is being adjusted.<br /><br />This mounting stand is of such heavy construction that it suggests the stand was designed for industrial use. While it is just fine for home use and is not out of place in a professional office, it is a good for a manufacturing assembly line or even a busy retail location.<br /><br />This is a great mounting stand for tablets in 7""-11"" range. The whole stand is very sturdy and solid and is build to last. Based on my experience with it I can heartily recommend it to any one who needs a mounting solution for a tablet.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",positive,negative
B06Y1D7P48,5.0,"[[VIDEOID:8c9fe6543edf9e4bd0345d22b1eaeac2]] Based on reviews, I wanted a HackRF One, but my auction order was canceled.

It was less than $40, so there wasn't much to lose.<br /><br />As you can see and here in my video, it works VERY WELL.  I expected lots of static and poor performance since even the Great Scott Gadgets tutorial on YouTube had a fair amount of static in lesson 1.  Granted, I likely have better signal strength here in South Florida, and I think my antenna is a bit better than the stock telescoping rod they were using in the video.  Instead, the RTL-SDR gave surprising good performance.<br /><br />That said, it's not a replacement for the HackRF One.  The first thing you'll notice, if you attempt to build any of the HackRF projects, is that you'll need to drastically reduce the sample rate.  The HackRF One can handle a 20MHz sampling rate; the RTL-SDR SMArTee XDR sampling rate is an order of magnitude lower - 2 MHz.  Furthermore, the RTL-SDR is receive only and that definitely limits its capabilities.  Even so, if you are looking for a cheap introduction to SDR, then definitely buy the RTL-SDR SMArTee XTR.  You won't regret it.",positive,negative

B09K7BFZ6T,4.0,"I have had the opportunity to review many headsets and headphones over the years and without question the recent technological advancements have aided this area by leaps and bounds.<br /><br />I can not recommend buying Bluetooth 5.2 enough over previous technologies if your devices support it.  Nearly all devices that are Bluetooth 5.2 capable, including this one, will be backwards compatible with earlier technologies as well.<br /><br />Battery life is outstanding with these headsets lasting a solid 5 hours each in all of my tests.  It is easily charged using the included charging case which will allow the earbuds to be recharged several times from its one full charge.  Since the earbuds can be used together for stereo sound or individually you can potentially double play time by using one at a time.<br /><br />This unique charging case is powered via an included super fast standard USB to USB Type C cable.  This case will allow the headsets to be recharged even when you don’t have access to electricity.<br /><br />After receiving, I made sure the case was fully charged then confirmed each earbud had a full charge.  After verifying full power within each earbud I followed the simple pairing instructions and had no problems whatsoever.  Once the earbuds are removed from the case they first pair with each other then you simply pair with your Bluetooth device.<br /><br />The design of these headset makes it so it fits securely in your ear and is relatively comfortable.  As someone who has used many of these units, this design is not the most comfortable as the weight is all on the ear canal.  I’ve found headsets that are worn only supported by the ear canal can end up being painful when used for extended periods.<br /><br />The sound from these headphones is decent - from the rich bass notes to the vibrant midtones to the bright treble.  I tested these headphones with a wide range of audio - from audiobooks to jazz, heavy metal, country, classical and blues - everything sounded reasonable.<br /><br />I have listened to both music and audiobooks through these as I moved throughout my home and it will easily pick up the signal through walls up to 25’ away, and even more without obstacles.  This is a decent set Bluetooth headphones.<br /><br />While these are great for listening to music, how are they for calling?  The sound through these headphones is absolutely outstanding - on both ends. That is not always the case.  Many of the other headphones I have tested, while they sound good to the person using it - those who they are speaking to can’t hear them clearly.  It is no fun having a conversation where the other person keeps saying, “huh, what did you say?”  You won’t have to worry about that with this set.<br /><br />If you are looking for a decent headphone set, especially one at a reasonable price, with decent sound and reception and has the power to last this is a great choice.",positive,positive

B00HEQRWU4,2.0,"We were looking for a boom box that didn't require a phone for our 10 year old. We thought this would fit the bill perfectly, but we were disappointed.  Although it is convenient that we can load the songs onto an SD card and pop that into the speaker, the controls are so obnoxious that we will be returning it.  The volume up/volume down, song forward/song backward, FF/RW buttons are all the same two buttons!  You hold them down to turn up/down the volume, you touch them quickly to change song. And you have to press HARD (for a 10 year old) to get them to respond. Try changing songs or changing volume only by the pressure of your fingers while pushing VERY hard!  It's such a pain!  Whoever designed this thing has never tried to use it.  They could have taken up 2 cm more and added the very most important buttons: volume.<br /><br />Plus the thing always turns on at MAX volume, causing everyone to shriek and cover their ears until you can madly try to turn the volume down.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's loud and has decent sound. It's also quite portable.  If the controls were good, we would have kept it. But they're such a pain to use, we will look for something else.

B09D9DMYH2,5.0,"My husband wanted a camera to put on an HO flatcar and run around his model railroad layout. He'd seen some videos friends made and was eager to try it. This unit is extremely versatile and comes with all sorts of features we didn't need and haven't tried, so you'll have to check other reviews for those. For example, there is no wifi at his layout and he hates smartphones, so we haven't bothered with that, at least not yet. We also did not need the waterproof case or some of the other amazing mounting brackets.<br /><br />When we unboxed the camera and got it out of the waterproof case (took a little figuring out), the next challenge was to find the plugs for the charging cord and the card. The design is sleek and beautiful so that's a trick. Turns out,it's a black rubber flap on the bottom which hinges up. Inserting the memory card was the next trick. At first, I didn't push down hard enough. (it won't go in much at all if you have it turned the wrong way, so don't worry about that--I did.) You have to push down really hard with your fingernail to get it to go in. It has to be all the way in so the outer edge of the card is flush with the outside of the unit. Once we did that, it was easy to turn on and worked great. The camera resolution is absolutely amazing. It's hard to believe something this small and inexpensive could work so well. It isn't the best for the layout because my husband's model railroad has a lot of tunnels. As small as the camera is, it's too tall to fit through them, at least when it's upright. Now, the description says it can be turned. Maybe there's a way to do it that we haven't discovered yet. On that point, I need to add that, while the directions that come in the box are hopeless, there are lots of terrific how-to and unboxing videos for this camera on YouTube. If I can ever get it away from my husband, I'd like to record some of the beautiful hikes and drives we take here in western Colorado. There's a lanyard for your neck for outdoor activities and a bracket for the car. You can also use it as a nanny cam or to monitor your doggie with your phone when you are out. I think everyone is going to have one of these things eventually. One last point, when I was having trouble getting the card in right, I contacted customer service via email. They got back to me with a very polite and useful reply within 48 hours. This camera would make a great gift for almost anybody!",positive,positive
B01F24RHF4,4.0,"Had some doubts due to the price but this speaker delivers.

I'm very pleased with the performance and value now.",positive,positive
B077Z7DBRT,4.0,"The sound quality I'm getting from this thing connected to some Pioneer SP-BS22-LR speakers is good, especially for the money. The sound quality isn't amazing, but I didn't want it to be for this price. It's a great way to add sound to a bedroom or office where you're not trying for critical listening. Setup is easy, with high-quality ports on the back.<br /><br />All of the problems are on the volume knob. The potentiometer control is cheap feeling, with no weight or satisfying resistance behind it. Again - not a problem at this price point. The problem is the BRIGHT BLUE LIGHT surrounding the volume knob like a halo, shining ALL OF THE TIME. It disqualifies this thing for bedroom use unless you hide it behind something. I draped a black sock over the front of mine so it wouldn't shine throughout the bedroom.<br /><br />I would pay more for a version of this that had no LEDs in it.",positive,negative
B07MWCNR3W,5.0,"Initially I purchased these as refurbs, sadly that didn't work out so well. However I liked them so much that I purchased new after Amazon took care of me.<br /><br />If you're looking for audiophile sound, look elsewhere. If you're looking for good quality sound, easy pairing, and comfort than I've found these to be a perfect choice. I wear them for about 2-3 hours at a time at work, never feel fatigued by them. I find they stay in with little effort and range is good, as I often walk away from my desk. My wife uses hers at work as well but only with 1 bud at a time. She agrees the quality is better than the airpods she has as well.<br /><br />Like I said, if you're interested in audiophile quality sound, then you'll need to look at other choices. I've found that these seal well an keep most ambient noise out, although there is a setting that allows a touch to let more in. Touch controls weren't the best at first but updates have pretty much got them spot on. Only occasionally do I have it register a single tap instead of a double.<br /><br />Somewhat durable, I've dropped mine once or twice with no issues.<br /><br />Overall a good choice.",positive,positive

B086STGJ49,4.0,"I have tested and reviewed literally hundreds of Bluetooth speakers and while I am not a fan of music that is particularly bass heavy I found this speaker produces rich, vibrant sounds from all wave lengths.  It produces more than ample volume for most any setting and has several connection methods.<br /><br />While I have tested and reviewed Bluetooth speakers costing ten times (and more) what this does, the sound quality from this speaker is really quite good.  In relation to the sound quality I would place them on par with mid to high end Bluetooth speakers.<br /><br />In regards to charging time and battery life, both are outstanding.  In my tests charging takes about approximately 2 hours to charge the built in 4000 mAh battery and the speaker lasts a solid 4.5 hours at max volume - 8 hour with volume midway (of course this will vary a bit due to exact settings).<br /><br />There are multiple ways to connect to this speaker including Bluetooth 5.0, which can reach much further than previous versions, through an AUX cable, a 3.5mm jack, TF card, USB flash drive, or FM radio - it even has a built in extendable antenna.<br /><br />While it has a remote and I tested it and it works fine, I rarely use it as I connect with my phone all the time.<br /><br />I have taken this speaker with me to the pool for the last couple of months and have been thoroughly impressed with its performance.  The battery, being 4000 mAh, is much longer lasting than most allowing for all day listening and the sound quality has been really good.<br /><br />This is an all around great Bluetooth speaker that I certainly recommend.",positive,positive

Connects great to an adapter I use for my audio player, connects no trouble to tablets or phones or PC. Sound is good, I have your medium average female ears I guess, so it fits fine over the ears and I have had trouble in the past with some headphones being too large, with these you can set the adjustment down and they fit really well. If you are a person with a large head, you might want to keep looking, but these do adjust quite a bit so it's worth a shot. I get really good sound no matter the device, and podcasts sound so good sometimes it's sounded like they were in the room. The sound you get can be excellent if you have a device with a good equalizer. I have been really shocked how good the battery has been. If it's fully charged, I could listen to music on my phone for a couple hours, and check the percentage and it's barely used any battery. I go to plug it in and it charges really fast. I've had really good luck with these. I don't expect them to be like Bose or something, but for an average user, these are good.",positive,positive

B00CDGSNL2,5.0,"I will give you the down and dirty in short bullet form. Hopefully this answers most questions.<br /><br />PROS of this product<br />* Easy to set up and use.<br />* Quality of the sound is good and it isn't heavy on the bass. Music is clear. The one speaker (mono) gives off great sound.<br />*Item is portable and sturdy.<br />*Item has Bluetooth function or you can hook it straight to your device. (I used my son's cord from his VModa head-set to connect to my android. ) Otherwise I used the Bluetooth function on my IPAD, IPOD and Nexus 4 (android phone) with no problem. The range or reception is decent.  I didn't have any breaks in the connection, but I really didn't try to go too far. I tend to stay in the same room or in the general area, while listening to music.<br />*You can control the sound from your device or from the speaker. AND you can still pause your music using your device.<br />*Easy to charge. I really liked the fact that it is compatible with any USB or android charger. Meaning if you have an Apple device (ex., IPOD or IPAD), etc you can use the charger to charge this speaker. Or at least use the base portion of the charger.  If you have an android, you can use that cord as well. The charge life for the battery is reasonable, and it even comes with a lithium battery.<br />*You can attach it to a book-bag or backpack (as shown in the photo), but I just place it where I want it to be and put it down. It is small enough (about the size of the palm of my hand) to fit into any purse, or bag without making it too heavy. Basically you can use this anywhere (in the home, camping, on trips, at the beach) and at any time.<br />* It's cute (I have the black. It kind of looks like a smashed soda can). Again, it's small. There are controls and indicator lights on the bottom of the device. The charge area is located on the top.<br />*Price seems comparable with other products of this sort (wireless speakers) on the market.<br /><br />THINGS I WOULD CHANGE (not really a CON) about this product:<br />*The USB cord could be a bit longer. It was a little short for my tastes. But at least it's versatile.<br /><br />So, as you can see, I was pleased with this product. The PROS definitely outweigh the ""things that I would change"" category. It had everything that made this a winner. It was easy to set up, and has decent sound quality. I definitely would recommend it.",positive,positive

You will see the charge on the speaker on the very top by the on off button. On the top of the speaker, you will see a Bluetooth pairing button and symbols to show if it is connected or not. One charge will yield about 12 hours of play time. On the top, you will see the speaker also has NFC capability. You will also see buttons for volume. The sound is what you would expect from Bose.

B09JBBL6LQ,5.0,"This is ideal for anyone who has multiple devices needing charge on a nightly basis.. Yess!!! I’m  speaking from experience and traveling with a family of 6.. (we’re sort of a small gang!) Hotels always seem to have limited outlets.. and majority of those are already in use for lamps and the rooms light sources. This is great for single traveler as well since most individuals has more then x1 item needing a charge- it offers a real convenience, it’s truly ideal for anyone…<br /><br />Small enough to fit in your luggage or even carry-on bag/backpack without a large footprint. Cord length is perfect providing slack to reach from wall outlet with the ability to set on top of dresser, counter, table, etc.. Yet, not too long to be carrying a lasso of cord!<br /><br />This has a standard US plug- and would need an adapter outside the United States. Equipped to charge multiple items simultaneously and has surge protection if failure- x6 items charging at once we had zero issues tripping any power source- a really nice feeling! Note: there is no rapid charge capability on this power source- but, even with multiple items at once… All were at full capacity when charged overnight. *One can still use and have access to their device while it’s charging if necessary-<br /><br />Best idea to have one of these!! I’d recommend to anyone for even their daily needs if wanting to simplify and charge devices in one space. And a total no-brainer to carry something like this with you while traveling.. at $24 price point- you’ll get plenty of problem solving use! Hoping this info can help make your decision.. stay safe everyone.",positive,positive
B000XPSH70,5.0,"I was hesitent to purchase this wire after reading so many negative reviews.  After receiving and reviewing this speaker wire, I'm at a loss to explain those reviews.  I am now retired but had spend a 40 year career working in electronics.  The wire was as described.  Excellent quality, 12 gauge.  It came with a red stripe to identify the hot lead.  The leads were individual strands of copper wire, not coated aluminum.  There was no large solid core surrounded by a few stand in order to cheapen construction while trying to meet the 12 gauge requirement.  The insulation was of high quality and easy to strip.  I've already run the entire 100 feet, it was one solid piece of wire and not pieces of different lengths as another has complained of.  I actually purchased this wire based on reviews at other sights, the reviews here were so bad, I had to see if the complaints were also present elsewhere.  They weren't.  I can't understand why many Amazon reviewers found so many problems when those negative reviews weren't duplicated at other sights (or by me).  It may be the luck of the draw but I am completely satisfied with the product.  It's actually worth quite a bit more than it's sale price, I must recommend it.",positive,positive
B09P85ZN9B,5.0,Turn this on and you’ll see immediately that is a solid speaker with some power.  I’ve bought a few items from this brand and it’s been very good so far.  They make good speakers at an affordable price.<br /><br />This has a huge rubber guard to protect the charging ports from water.  This makes me feel safe about it being in the shower.  The suction cup screws onto the back easy enough but took some force to stick to the wall.<br /><br />Lights are nice and bright.  Nice effect.  Has a band on the back too so you can hold it easy if you’re moving with it.,positive,positive
B005SE6QBU,5.0,"In an earlier review I noted that this otherwise fantastic set of speakers was flawed with a faulty volume know (it would often turn the volume up when you were going down and vice versa).  Finally I got the bright idea, some three years later, to let Audioengine know about the problem.  They immediately dispatched a shipping label and I had the repaired speakers back in my hands in about a week and a half.<br /><br />All I can add to the many reviews about the great sound and good looks is that the company is great too.  They stood behind their products and left me very impressed.",positive,positive

If you want a projector to use with the lights on then you're looking at spending hundreds and thousands. For most people this projector is more than enough!

We have had people from other campsites show up and come watch a movie with us, it's really fun!

B0009N5MDI,5.0,"I got these for a good deal after rebate, and was worried about the breakage problems I read about, but for the price I couldn't pass them up.  I've had them for about 3 months now and I must say, I love them.  I haven't seen any evidence of cracking, I believe that the problem has been fixed, or perhaps I got lucky.  Either way, the quality seems great to me, both build and sound.  I use them at work with my computer and it's great not to have to deal with tangled cords.  The batteries easily last for a full 8-9 hour day and I definitely get a lot of questions about them from people around the office.  Overall I'd have to say if you can get them for under $50 after rebate you really can't pass these up.<br /><br />Edit: The headphones finally did break after about 8 months of daily use.  Logitech sent me a replacement pair (which was really easy, no hassle, great customer service), which worked well for about 4 more months, and then the headband broke on those as well.  When I called for another replacement pair, they told me that they were discontinued and instead they would just refund me what I paid for them.  All in all, I'd say they were a great deal, but minus 1 star because they are pretty flimsy (I'd actually change the star rating if Amazon would let me, but I can't).",positive,negative

B00NQ8OW7A,1.0,This cable is the worst audio cable I have ever owned. It degrades audio quality to such an extent that my $200 ATs sounded like the cheapest pair you can pickup from a grocery store. This isn't good enough to even be sold at Walmart. I decided to perform a social experiment with this cable. I put this crappy cable on some beats studios and did a blind comparison with some people at work. I had them blindfolded and placed a pair of Disney Frozen phones and played John Mayer's waiting on the world to change. Then I placed the Beats on with the same track. Before removing the blindfold I asked them which pair they liked the most. The $5 Frozen set won unanimously. Thank you for turning a $200 pair into a sub $5 set.,negative,negative

It does a poor job of picking up the wireless analog signal I'm broadcasting from an agile modulator. For this TV set, this Vuelve antenna has given me the best results. You'll see in my video, when I move the antenna to the right, picture gets worse, to the left, picture gets better. That's all you can ask for, an antenna that actually responds. This means there is exist a sweet spot, so I will find it and mount it at that location. I believe the signal booster included in this package is the reason it has performed better than others that I have tried on this TV. 32.8 ft cord means ample cord for you to set the antenna anywhere you like. 5-Stars!",positive,negative

B005IIRAC0,3.0,"First, a warning for you about the warranty. This Speaker Tower is very, very heavy. Should it break during the one-year warranty, as expected you will have to pay to ship it to Pyle. (I am OK with this.) But along with the item you must include a $50 money order to pay Pyle Audio to send the item back to you.<br /><br />Most companies work by you pay to ship the broken item to them, they pay to ship the fixed item back to you under the warranty period.<br /><br />OK, now to the product review:<br /><br />Overall, I am disappointed with the quality of the audio and I do not recommend this item to people who want the best audio quality and I would not ever purchase it again.<br /><br />If anyone out there paid even close to the full retail list price of $433.99, you have my sympathy.<br /><br />This tower does have some positives. The ability to play either FM radio, an iOS device, or other music source (you will need a 3.5mm to dual RCA male cable if wanting to play directly from the headphone jack of an MP3 player, etc.). It would have been nice if they had included a 3.5mm input jack as well, especially at this price.<br /><br />Some songs sound pretty good, but others sound muffled or muddy. Not crystal clear like you would expect at this weight and price, and from Pyle Audio. If you compare your songs through this tower and then through the $300+ Dr. Dre Original Model Beatbox as one wild example, you will hear the difference in clarity and quality from the speakers immediately.<br /><br />But again, some songs do sound quite decent, and with that I can see why some give this tower a great review. But if you are like me and you want and recognize the best quality sound, you might be disappointed with this tower.<br /><br />The instruction manual is very disappointing, as well. I, and most can figure things out eventually, but there will be some folks who might need to ask for help.<br /><br />The FM antenna is a small hard wired wire. You cannot add your own antenna.<br /><br />I got the black matte model, and it does look nice in the room.<br /><br />I think this deserves 3 stars because I think there are some people who will enjoy this tower and its features and its small footprint and its look for the $171 price.",positive,negative
B001PO6JLO,2.0,"I bought the printer because it was affordable, and had lots of features. I wanted something with a duplex document feeder scanner, full duplex printing, color, and flatbed scanning. This seemed to have it all. As a scanner, it's pretty good if you manage to stay away from the HP software. As a printer, the quality is decent, but the ink situation is enough to make me never buy from HP again.<br /><br />I'm sure HP read lots and lots of letters from angry customers complaining about their ink prices. Indeed, with other HP printers, it can be frustrating to be charged $35 when you run out of black ink. HP's solution to this can be seen with the 564 ink cartridge - the colors are $10 and the black is $12. Seems cheap!<br /><br />Here's the awful truth: the black ink lasts about 30 - 50 pages. This is not an exaggeration. You need to replace the ink ALL THE TIME. The printer also has a bizarre habit of using ALL of the colors even when you're printing things that look black and white. So even if you're not printing very much in color at all, the printer will inexplicably run out of colors. Since the ink cartridges are so small, it seems like the printer CONSTANTLY has a low ink warning, and is CONSTANTLY stopping with out of ink errors. So even though you're only spending $10 - $12 on each cartridge, you're buying tons of them, and you need a huge stock for replenishment. This is HP's marketing department guiding the hand of their engineering department and delivering a crippled product. You will learn to hate this printer. It will constantly need your care and feeding, and you won't save any money on ink.<br /><br />Here's a tip: in the print settings on your computer, you can tell it to use black ink only. That's a lifesafer.<br /><br />Side note: the wi-fi on my unit has gone out twice. Out of warranty though, but the range on the Bluetooth is excellent, so not that big a problem for me. Don't know if it's endemic, or isolated.",negative,negative

B01MUG5WIN,3.0,"I purchased four other Bluetooth speakers for my house over a several year period. I have a [[ASIN:B007ZG03DG Bose Wave Bluetooth Music Adapter]], which is not very good and a [[ASIN:B00MPMK3GW Goal Zero 94014 Rock Out 2 Green Solar Rechargeable Speaker]] which does not work when paired with some devices and, when it does pair well, it usually lacks the powerful sound I am looking for.<br /><br />I also purchased one [[ASIN:B00SNBCBBY ION Audio Block Rocker (iPA76A) | Portable Bluetooth Speaker]] and one [[ASIN:B01N17AQ7U ION Audio IPA88 Tailgater Flash Wireless/Bluetooth Speaker]] both from Costco. I absolutely love the Block Rocker (except for when paired with my iPad Pro) and I only like the Tailgate Flash. The lights on the Tailgate Flash annoy me because they have to be turned off every time I power on the unit. Nevertheless, the sound from the ION speakers are usually awesome.<br /><br />The IONs are the only ones I use frequently indoors (even though they are more of an outdoor Bluetooth speaker). They are powerful speakers and the sound is intense. However, I wanted something small and more portable and since the Goal Zero does not always function, I figured I would try this Sony.<br /><br />What comes in the Sony box<br />- one Bluetooth speaker<br />- one micro USB charging cable<br />- one quick start guide<br />- one user guide - warns against using & leaving unit in a car or sauna but does not say much about how to operate this speaker<br />- one limited 1-year warranty insert<br />- one pamphlet about the SongPal app - a mobile app from Sony that allows the user to play music or audio from various devices and smartphones.<br /><br />Features on the SONY<br /><br />- It is rated as IPX5 water resistant (not waterproof but close enough; it probably will not soak through in a short burst of heavy rain). See link in comments section of review for description of ratings.<br /><br />- It features a wireless party chain that allows a connection of up to 10 Bluetooth speakers at once. I did not try this feature. I am not sure if all in the party chain have to be Sony speakers or not.<br /><br />- It has a speaker phone voice assist function to allow for hands free voice over IP through the speaker, which I was unable to get working.<br /><br />- It lights up (great for party or listening to vibrant music). I love how the blue light pulsates to the music but it can be turned off if desired and once it is turned off, it remembers that setting until it is turned on again.<br /><br />- It has a speaker add function for adding an extra Sony speaker for surround sound.<br /><br />- It has up to 12 hours of battery life.<br /><br />- It charges from most USB power sources including from the USB port on a laptop<br /><br />These are the control buttons from left to right.<br /><br />- Extra Bass Button (toggles on and off for extra bass); when held for a few seconds it turns off the blue perimeter light. I like that it remembers the last setting so if I turned off the light, the light will remain off until I choose to turn it on again.<br /><br />- Phone Button for speaker phone assist; when held for a few seconds, it says the battery charge percentage. However, I found a quirk in the system. If I am charging the unit and turn it on to get the battery charge percentage, a woman’s voice came on and said 70%. However, if I unplugged the unit from a power source and turned it on, it said it was fully charged.<br /><br />- Pause and Play toggle button<br /><br />- Speaker Add button (Left/Right) for pairing another Sony speaker to this unit for surround sound.<br /><br />- Minus button for lowering volume.<br /><br />- Plus button for increasing volume.<br /><br />- Power button for tuning the unit on. Once unit is powered on, hold the power button for a few seconds and then release it to pair a device to the Bluetooth speaker. Upon release, a female voice says “pairing” and then it beeps once it is paired.<br /><br />I charged the speaker for a couple of hours before the first use but I am not sure it needed it as the battery indictor fluctuated between 100% and 70% charged depending on whether the unit was plugged in or not. The connector port is located behind the tiny cover on the back of the unit. I had trouble opening this with my fingernails.<br /><br />I paired this speaker with the following devices.<br /><br />- Google Nexus 7 Tablet (2013 version Android device) – the sound is moderately powerful.<br /><br />- iPad Pro 12.9 – the sound is okay; I actually prefer the powerful sound that is supplied by the iPad Pro’s own speakers over this Sony speaker. The system wanted me to install SongPal as an option; I found it under another name and after installation, the app said it would probably slow down my iPad so I immediately deleted it.<br /><br />- HP Omen Laptop – the sound is powerful and much better than the Omen’s own speakers.<br /><br />- Dell Latitude E7470 Laptop – the sound is powerful and much better than the Dell’s own speakers.<br /><br />As usual, I am disappointed in the user guide. It does not describe each button. It only mentions the Voice Guidance usage and does a poor job at that. However, the quick start guide pictorially shows the buttons as long as one can decipher the pictures.<br /><br />In summary, the unit is sleek, simple, and shaped like a super-sized oblong pill. It is heavy at 1.45 pounds. When powered on, a blue perimeter light outlines the speaker and pulsates to music.  I found this speaker to be moderately powerful when paired with three of the four devices I tried it on. I did not like the sound with the iPad Pro. To get the best performance, I needed to leave on the “Extra Bass.” The battery-charging indicator is a bit quirky and untrustworthy. The charge percentage was different depending on whether I was plugged in or not. I like that it is portable and water resistant. The instructions could be better and until I figured out the unit, I initially had trouble pairing. When using the phone button, I was unable to get voice over IP to route through the speaker no matter what I did. Overall, in comparison to my very portal Goal Zero speaker, this speaker is better. Although it is an unfair comparison, no portable speaker has yet to compare to my two ION speakers. I would have rated this four stars if it were not for the lousy written instructions, the quirky battery charge indicator, and its failure of the speaker phone voice assist. I was also very disappointed in the sound with my iPad Pro. Other than this, this speaker is a good contender for the right application.",positive,negative

B00LORB232,5.0,"J. Chambers'  November 4, 2014 review provides the complete specs that are missing from the product description at the time of this review as well as a helpful video. I will not repeat his information and encourage you to read it.<br /><br />Like him I received my station as a review sample. What I like about this versus other surge protector solutions is this one actually has features that protects against electrical surges and spikes and provides the specs to back them up. That may sound like a no-brainer, but I have reviewed 'surge protectors' in the past that were really power strips with no real protection.<br /><br />What I especially like is the small, convenient footprint. That, plus the three outlets (one what is spaced to accommodate wall warts), and the convenience of two USB charging ports. I will say that the charging ports are slow. On my Galaxy Note 3 phone using a high speed wall charger I get a 1% per 2.5 minutes charging rate. It's over 5.5 minutes with this station, but for overnight charging is not an issue for me. Do factor that into your purchase decision, though. Another thing to take into account is the slide out holder for phones is 7/16 inches fully extended and may not accommodate most phones unless you remove them from any protective case. I charge my phone flat on my desk top, so it's not an issue for me, but if you want to take complete advantage of this station's features you should measure your phone's thickness in its case.<br /><br />Bottom line: I am totally pleased with this station despite some of the noted limitations. The convenience to me outweighs the compromises, which I cited to ensure that you are armed with enough information to make a purchase decision.",positive,positive
B075RNKT6G,5.0,"I upgraded from a year-old, previous-generation Paperwhite, mostly to gain the new inverted white-on-black screen mode that Amazon insists requires new hardware and to have built-in Audible playback over Bluetooth.<br /><br />This unit ticks most of boxes, and after some debate I've decided to give it five stars, but there are some imperfections worth knowing about.  It's mostly good, though, and often great.<br /><br />Battery life<br />No complaints.  In several long international flights, I've yet to run it down more than about 30%, either in long reading sessions with the front-light or in lengthy Audible playback sessions over Bluetooth.<br /><br />Audible content<br />The Audible player works brilliantly.  Excellent sound, simple controls (including playback-speed adjustment).  It does work best if you don't have a screen password enabled, though-- that will get in the way if you just want to rewind a few seconds to catch something you missed.  Playback proceeds even if you have a case closed, which shuts off the front-light and saves battery charge.<br /><br />There's no headphone jack-- this is for Bluetooth only.  Fine with me.  I have Bluetooth-enabled hearing aids (cochlear implants, actually) and it's a true joy to be able to listen to books on this device.  Thanks, Amazon.<br /><br />Screen<br />The screen is pretty much the same as my previous-generation Paperwhite's, meaning not bad but could use more contrast when reading in a dark room using the front-light.  Outdoors or in well-lit areas, it's fantastic and mostly glare-free.<br /><br />More seriously, the lack of contrast mars the new Paperwhite's valuable ability to invert text to white-on-black.  This is a marvelous accessibility feature for those with ""floaters"", vitreous separation and other vision issues.  Unfortunately, when used with the front-light in a darkened room, such as when reading at night or in a darkened airplane, the black background is more of a medium gray.  So this new feature is less helpful than it could be.  In fairness, poor contrast is characteristic of today's e-ink displays, which provide perhaps 8:1 contrast.  If Amazon can significantly improve the contrast, I'd upgrade again in a flash.<br /><br />The screen is plastic and will scratch.  Keep it clean and use a case.  Even with a case (I prefer one of the various ""origami"" cases available here, which allow the Kindle to prop itself upright) it will fit nicely into a pocket.<br /><br />The touch-screen user interface is the same as the previous-gen Paperwhite's.  I'm not a huge fan of it; too easy to touch it when you don't mean to, and end up on the wrong page.  But, the earlier button-driven Kindles had sort of the same problem, so whatever.  I recommend a simple fix, perhaps as a Settings option: require a double-tap rather than a single-tap.  How about it, Amazon?<br /><br />Connectivity<br />The 4G/LTE capability is a nice speed upgrade from the previous 3G connectivity.  Downloading Audible content requires a WiFi connection as before.<br /><br />Unfortunately I'm finding that global connectivity with the new 4G hardware is inferior to the previous-gen's 3G radio.  For example, my year-old 3G Paperwhite connected without issue in Saigon, but the new one won't.<br /><br />The user interface for turning Airplane Mode on and off could be improved.  As it is, engaging Airplane Mode cuts all connectivity including Bluetooth.  So if you're in the middle of listening to a book when the time comes to put your gizmos in Airplane Mode, it will cut your connection.  Better to do what the latest iPhones do, and have the device learn if your usage prefers that Bluetooth remain active.<br /><br />Browser<br />It's high time for Amazon to replace the minimally-functional ""Experimental Browser"" with something more useful.  I get it that Kindles are all about battery life and browsers can be major energy hogs, but c'mon, it's 2019, and this browser feels like a relic from 1996.  Probably is.",positive,positive

B007G95FJE,3.0,"This is my first exposure to Panasonic Active Noise Canceling (ANC) headphones. This particular model is very inexpensive relative to most ANC phones on the market, and unfortunately the low price is justified. These phones fall short in a couple of important areas.<br /><br />First and foremost, these are ANC phones and the ANC function does indeed work. That said, the degree to which it works is in line with the pricing. I have a very specific fan in the house that I use as a benchmark, as most ANC phones are able to nearly completely wipe out the white noise that this fan generates when on the lowest speed setting. The Panasonic phones kill a good bit of the fan noise but allow more noise than almost every other ANC set I have tried. In the office I tried these phones in an area serviced by two large air handlers that generate a lot of noise and these headphones did remarkably well though still not as well as most other phones I have tried in the same environment. Now, when compared to the likes of Bose, Panasonic does a very poor job but then again they cost maybe 15% of what Bose costs. When considering this price differential the Panasonic phones do a decent job with their ANC which should be acceptable by most for traveling.<br /><br />One area where these phones fail, though, is in build quality. These headphones are extremely lightweight and they feel very flimsy and fragile. These are not the headphones to take when traveling frequently. To add insult to injury, they come with a cloth carry bag which offers absolutely no protection at all beyond serving as a dust cover.<br /><br />Worse, though, is the miserable sound quality. I don't know if my specific headset is the problem but while I have a decent full range of sound, everything across the spectrum sounds slightly tinny and hollow. I was encouraged that Panasonic does not overdrive the bass as many manufacturers tend to do and instead delivers a fairly balanced spectrum, but this does not make up for the poor quality of sound. As these are inexpensive headphones I would never expect them to be audiophile quality, but the sound should absolutely be much better than it is.<br /><br />I was encouraged to see that Panasonic includes a 2-prong adapter in the package, but then they omit the 1/4&#34; adapter which is something I actually use.<br /><br />Panasonic has made a very inexpensive ANC headphone and unfortunately the low cost is justified. While the ANC capabilities are within reason for the price range, the sound quality and build quality are severely lacking. If looking for ANC phones for the purpose of using the ANC function, and keeping costs low is important, then these phones may fill that need acceptably. However, if sound quality is in any way important, these are the wrong phones and will sorely disappoint.",positive,negative

Your laptop is protected in all corners as your able to place it within a “pocket”. The padding is ample enough to protect your laptop in almost all situations. I am able to fit my 13” MacBook Air and 11” iPad Pro within the bag. the outer two compartments are functional and have a thin piece of padding between the interior and exterior, which adds a bit of protection for the items you stow inside.",positive,negative

Plugging in one good optical source (ON), I noticed the output from each of the channels individually showed up as 2 red dots slightly skewed ""oo"" instead of one solid red dot ""O"".  This reduced the signal and probably corrupted it such that the signal could not be processed by my receiver.

B00JZSB7NW,3.0,"It is, by far, the best GPS I have ever had.  Big, bright, clear display; intuitive menus; useful information.  So what's wrong.  The Smart Link app that provides the unit with weather and other information.  The connection is Bluetooth, but it often fails to relink after you re-approach the unit.  And getting it relinked is sometimes painfully difficult.  It will show the units connected on one page and not connected on another.  It can be damn frustrating.  There is also a feature that shows where you parked your car.  I used it the other day, and it reported my car was 32 miles away.  The weather is M-Powered.  Problem is the M-Power iPhone app itself is not highly rated.  One problem is that it will display a warning or watch area, but will sometimes fail to delete that map layer so that you can see the actual storms...which you can see with your eye and on the unit sometime later.  Garmin needs to do some serious work on this feature.<br /><br />If you are serious about what the Smart Link feature can do, do not buy this unit until Garmin gets serious about fixing it.",positive,negative

On average, they last a few months and then deteriorate. Often times, because I have a tendency to drop the mouse a lot, they break pretty fast. The mouse included with this keyboard has held up well.  As with most other mouses, when they are dropped, the batteries come flying out.  To avoid this, I have placed a small piece of tape over the battery cover and case being careful not to cover the mouse's optical component.

B00YQ8K3AY,2.0,"UPDATE:  DIED after 2 months of use.  I'm not a heavy or careless user of this kind of stuff -- this was plugged into a connector on my nightstand that also handled a mini-USB cable for my bluetooth speaker, and wasn't moved around at all.  I tested it initially with my iPad Pro and my iPhone, but after the initial testing, it was used ONLY for charging my iPhone 6s usually 3 times per week or so.  The first 6 weeks, it worked perfectly, and I was thrilled with it.  Unfortunately, it started malfunctioning after 6 weeks (lights flashing randomly); after 8 weeks of use, it no longer worked at all.  CANNOT recommend.  Sorry.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I've been living with this for about 10 days and I've had a chance to use it with my new-ish iPad Pro 9.7&#34; and iPhone 6S.<br /><br />So far, no problems at all.  Functions just like the original cable except this one is longer and has some extra features -- aluminum housing on both ends is much more &#34;solid&#34; than the plastic and everything is well secured with no manufacturing defects that I could find.<br /><br />Probably the best part of this cable is the LED light that tells you where your device is in the charging process.  Pulsing red means it's charging; flickering green means it's almost done; solid green means it's 100%.  The solid green light stays on for awhile (haven't been able to time it precisely as it seems to vary a little from charge to charge -- I'm thinking maybe a couple of hours or so before it goes off; then it stays off unless something &#34;wakes it up&#34; (a notification, a phone call, etc.).  I charge the phone on my nightstand and I've had no problem with brightness, but then I sleep like a rock once I get to sleep and it didn't keep me awake, either.  Some folks might have a problem, though, because the light is rather bright.<br /><br />It fits just fine with my Speck case on the iPhone and the MoKo ultra-light case on the iPad.<br /><br />I actually like this enough that I'll be ordering another one before I make my annual trip back home for the holidays so I can charge both devices at once.  It's a nice cable, well made, great length, and I can tell by looking at it whether my device is finished charging.",negative,negative

B08GCCYSL1,4.0,"I have been working with security camera products for over 20 years - over that time I have installed systems for businesses, corporations and individuals - from enormous multimillion dollar systems to single camera nursery monitors.  I’ve consulted on large projects and written about security vulnerabilities within networks for trade publications.<br /><br />This is a field I know well.  Over the years the technology has improved and become less and less expensive to produce.  It is now practical to install security systems that would have only previously been used in commercial settings in residential.<br /><br />As with all security systems my advice is never use cloud based recording - this opens your entire network to not only the company who you are giving blanket access too but also to hackers.  The same is true for WiFi.  Obviously WiFi is more convenient but if your privacy is a concern this really needs to be taken into account.  Hackers have become quite adept at hacking into WiFi cameras and being able to not only watch your feed but control your cameras and access your entire network.  If you choose to utilize WiFi cameras take the time to understand your router and employ proper VPN protocols.<br /><br />Due to my security concerns with WiFi cameras my current security system is completely run through a dedicated computer utilizing the Blue Iris software.  While this may seem intimidating to some, it is well worth learning and utilizing for the huge advantages in privacy and security.<br /><br />I’ve noticed many people have asked if this camera works with a Blue Iris and it does without any issue.  Just update to the latest firmware.  The remainder of setup within Blue Iris is straightforward.  This IPC2387C supports PoE 802.3af and will work with 48V active adapters which are more expensive, but you can also rely on a PoE switch, which in my opinion is a much easier, straightforward option.  Something to note, if you plan on powering via a DC cable this is not included.<br /><br />The fixed lens size of 2.8mm provides decent field of view and the digital zoom is acceptable.  The 1/2.8” CMOS 8MP image sensor is decent in low light, certainly not as good as 1/1.8” but I’ve found the low light capabilities average in comparison to other similar cameras.  The LEDs must be illuminating objects to provide what is considered “colored night vision” which is misleading.<br /><br />The camera has a built in microphone that allows for sound recording, though no speaker so two way communication will not be possible with this unit.<br /><br />In terms of storage, the IPC2387C utilizes H.265 which is currently the best option for video compression.  I have had this set up utilizing Blue Iris software which I definitely recommend.<br /><br />When all things are taken into account this is a solidly build camera, suited to outdoor environments, decent daytime / nighttime resolution, fairly easily mounted, and setup in Blue Iris was reasonably easy and straightforward.<br /><br />While I would prefer to have pan and tilt capabilities at this price point that is unrealistic.  Overall I have been moderately impressed with this budget camera and would recommend it for many security situations.",positive,positive

I was pleasantly surprised and it didn’t have issues with quality (sometimes speakers get louder in volume and it sounds like someone just singing closer and closer to a microphone).<br /><br />This does include a short Aux cord (2 ft) and the charging cable (but no plug).

His  record of catches lately is lookin' pretty slim, so I'm sure he'll be tickled.<br /><br />EDIT:  Just over one month of usage, it is not working.  The mouse takes batteries and the batteries could not be bad yet!  But the mouse died, and when I press it, I see a light come on, but it will not hold!<br /><br />The mouse is generally designed to curve or flatten, so as to pack it with you when you travel with your laptop, I assume.  In order to take it with you, you need to take the USB receiver and there is a convenient magnetic slot to hold that USB receiver.  I'm quite that is an advantage with this mouse, to carry it with you, packs flat, receiver in tow.<br /><br />The key elements in this design are:  curve for comfort, flatten to pack, and it operates on a click tap, flick control.  Now, granted there is a lot of auto rolling that the mouse does, that's great, but not worth the wear and tear of the forefinger.<br /><br />The mouse is hard plastic, designed for cradling the palm.  The controls are situated on the forefront on the glossy-covered top of the mouse.<br /><br />The touch to scroll design is not always a simple touch, and I find myself tapping too much just to get some action going.  You are to slide your finger up and down the strip, but believe me, it doesn't do anything often.<br /><br />Takes Too Much Pressure to Click!  My forefinger HURTS !<br />Second, Clicking on the left side of the mouse takes way too much pressure from the finger.

B07WD8CWCW,4.0,"I ordered the 'Soundcore Wakey Bluetooth Speaker Powered by Anker with Alarm Clock, Stereo Sound, FM Radio, White Noise, QI Wireless Charger with 7.5W Charging for iPhone and 10W for Samsung' for review and would like to share some of my thoughts after a few weeks.<br /><br />First off, this thing is actually pretty amazing. The build quality is nice and aesthetically it looks clean. The sound quality is nice but not phenomenal. However for how small it is, it does produce decent sound and for a bedside alarm clock it does quite well. The wireless charging works great for my Galaxy Note 8 (and does in fact Fast-Charge) however there have been a couple nights to where my phone was not charged the next morning. The fast charger also works with my wireless earbuds which I attached an image showing the charge light on the Wakey, and the wireless earbuds case indicating charging. However for the wireless earbud charging, it does take some precise positioning to get them to charge. I noticed in other review that others weren't happy with the bright display light with no way to adjust it any dimmer than the lowest setting, however they must have updated that with a firmware update (which was super easy to do) as I had no issues with the display being too bright at night. I use the auto adjust setting which seems to work quite well as far as I can tell. Also I love the sleep mode sounds that you can adjust several (or just one) sound volumes to create your own personalized preference. I do wish that there were more sound options but the ones they provide are acceptable. I also wish that you could download and install more alarm sounds. Bluetooth connectivity is super quick and have never once had an issue with pairing it up to my phone. Really the ONLY issue I have with the Wakey is that to get the sleep mode sounds going, you need to connect with the app, and via Bluetooth connect to the device. No big deal right? Well my concern is that you will need to keep it connected for this feature to work. This means you will be connected to the Wakey ALL night and this kind of bugs me. It's just kind of creepy that the Wakey is connected to your phone all night while you sleep. I wish there was a way to just play your favorite white noise sleep sound by pressing a button on the Wakey device without having to always connect and stay connected to the app and your phone. The other gripe is that the plug design is huge and makes it so that I have had to move my nightstand further way from the wall to use it. Other than those two  gripes, and the only reason for docking one star, the Soundcore Wakey is a very good product and a really great value.<br />*On a side note - I just tested the Wakey while watching some Youtube videos and the latency is not so good. There is quite a bit of delay and the voices do not sync up at all so I wouldn't recommend using the Wakey for listening to videos.",positive,positive
B07GKJ4DDN,5.0,"My daughter enjoys listening to music in bed and on car trips. The problem with traditional headphones are that they either fall our of her ears (earbuds) or are uncomfortable if she falls asleep (over the ear). This solves those issues. Although these are advertised as more of a eye mask with music, which I imagine would be a sensory experience to promote sleep, my daughter uses them more like a headband/sweatband to wear around the house. She just cleaned her room wearing them over her forehead and it reminded me of an 80's workout video. If it's cold outside, I think they'd make a pretty interesting alternative to keep your child's ears warm as well.<br />She says they are comfortable, and sound good, although I can't verify these claims since it doesn't really fit me.

B00HPQ0JVC,3.0,"Note: I would love to love this speaker set, but it has inconsistent performance with various devices. I received a review sample and was pleased by the sound when I plugged this into the phone port on my ThinkPad T61. The sound was clear and I could hear every note on the album that I use to test speakers (Miles Davis' [[ASIN:B000002ADT Kind of Blue]]). I use that album because the instruments in the ensemble cover low, mid and high range frequencies. The bass was a little thin, but with the speakers less than two feet away the sound was rich and I was happy.<br /><br />Where I started to experience problems was when I plugged this into the 3.5mm port on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone. There was static in the mix. The same with my [[ASIN:B00D029NNA Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 inch]] - static interfered with the music. My final test was to plug the 3.5mm cable end into an [[ASIN:B00AEJJRBK Avantree Cara Bluetooth 4.0 Handsfree stereo Car Kit with mic]] and connect via bluetooth. The sound was crystal clear.<br /><br />I am not sure what conclusions to draw. It could be something wrong with the Samsung phone and tablet, although both work perfectly with headphones which I have directly plugged into their 3.5mm ports. It may be that the 3.5mm cable and interface on the input of this speaker is overly sensitive to impedance and the slightest deviation will induce static. I am not sure, but because I was unable to get the same quality consistently across all devices with which I tested these speakers I subtracted two stars.<br /><br />Construction is exceptional, although I wish the design employed removable USB and 3.5mm cables instead of the fixed ones that provide power and signal inputs, and connect the two units. As it stands if a cable breaks it will take some skill to repair it. With removable, off-the-shelf cables a broken one can be rectified with a trip to an electronics store.<br /><br />Overall, on the two devices that I tested with which these speakers worked the sound was spectacular. On the other two it was unlistenable. If you are connecting this to a bluetooth receiver it's probably a safe choice, but if you are connecting this to anything else I would proceed with caution.",positive,negative
B08W1VGVGS,4.0,"The quality of the camera is good unless you are trying to record.

If you are doing a lot of recording, the quality isn't there - keep looking.",positive,negative
B0747LJMDJ,4.0,"These are good Bluetooth headphones. They are a little on the large side, but don't fully sit in the ear, so for most adults, they should be fine. They are a little big on me, but still usable without being uncomfortable. They sit pretty securely around the ear. The sound quality is good, but doesn't block outside sound, which is good if you are using these for running or areas where you kind of need to still be able to hear car horns and such. Really, the only problem I have with these is the battery life.They have to be charged daily, even if you don't use them. They just don't hold a charge as well as I would like. But just remember to charge them daily, and you're cool.",positive,positive
B08CVR9PVS,3.0,"For the price, this device is okay, but the user interface is pathetic.  The touch interface is annoying because it only applies to half the screen.  What's worse is when the device screen goes blank (to save battery life), you have to touch the screen - which performs one of the functions, like play or pause.  It's quite annoying.  The buttons of the touch screen are at the bottom and you can only navigate the interface by tapping up/down/left/right.  So doing things on the device is a chore<br /><br />I bought this for a friend and didn't spend much time with it - only to set it up.  So I don't have an opinion of the sound quality or the build quality.  However ... one comment on the latter.  I've seen a number of reviews for this and similar products which reference the weight of the device and correlation it to the quality of the build.  The 2 don't always to hand in hand.  The Chinese have been known to add lead weights to devices to make them heavier so that people will believe it's better build quality or material than it really is.  I don't know this to be the case with this device - just wanted to point out that weight may not be the telltale people think it is<br /><br />BTW - the USB cable is SHORT.  Probably only a foot at most.  Also, it's micro USB, which is a pain in the butt.<br /><br />The radio function required the use of headphones - as an antenna.  Kind of a pain for Bluetooth headphone users.  Also - if the headphones are plugged in, I presume you can't listen through the device's built in speaker (which is lackluster) or through an external Bluetooth speaker.  I can't confirm this because, as I said, I only spent about an hour using the device.<br /><br />FYI - the device has no internal storage.  The 32GB is in the form of a micro SDXC card.  This means if you opt to purchase a larger card to use with the device, you won't be adding to the 32GB, you'll be replacing it.",positive,negative

B09WVGTZ34,5.0,"For years I messed around with tripods for my lights stands. Although there's nothing wrong with tripods but sometimes, they take up too much space.

Or small projector, you can clamp your rig right on your desk for the gig. I also like that it has a quarter inch screw on the ball head that will go 390 degrees as you please and it's strong enough to hold a camera or small projector, if UNDER 22 pounds or around. And old boy, it is aviation alloy, with a matte surface that doesn't shine like some cheap plastic ones you know the kind. And what's really cool they give you 2. I also like that the clamps are padded, so it won't scratch your desk if it's two inches or less Jess. One more thing you can do with that quarter inch screw. is put your microphone on it too.

B079V5ZH32,5.0,"I charged these up and then tried them out. They fit nicely in my ear and the ear hooks and ear loops help them stay in place. I have had issues with those types of things previously, but on this set, they do what they are supposed to do. I am thrilled about this. Now, what would make the perfect, is if the charge lasted 12 hours, I listen to podcasts at night and 8 hours isn't going to be enough. With podcasts or with sleep music, bass is not a priority for me. But, because I have depression, I sleep longer than most people, even on my medication. Sometimes, I will wake up in the middle of the night and hear an interesting podcast, and with these staying in my ears, it makes it easier. My headphones are great but one pair slips around alot and the other pair which is a much better pair, has a very sensitive on off on the ear muff. But both of those will hold a good charge, These House of Marley are going to make for a better night's sleep without constant having to adjust the other headphones.",positive,positive
B09ZQSD516,5.0,"Ordered for my teen son who disses on poor Alexa as a music source bc she cant work as hard as he would like to belt out the sounds to his menagerie of music.. Yess!! He’s the one who likes deep bass when listening to his tunes- whether it’s metal, classic rock, or even the 80’s… the thump is what he loves for- and this Geektop blue tooth speaker will bring it! (May/not be good for all family members.. consider yourself warned!)<br /><br />The sound produced is deep.. it has a depth that doesn’t distort so that’s a big positive- the only thing worse then booming bass, is distorted bass!!! What surprises me with this speaker- is the ability to hear the varied individual Instruments in the music.. Surprisingly, those can be lost in a lot of subpar speaker/stereos! ie., listening to the 80’s group “Yaz” I asked who remade the song- come to find out it was the original!! I had just never heard a quality rendition of it to pick up on the keyboard synthesizer sounds in that specific capacity.. If that isnt proof enough- not sure what is!<br /><br />Speaker easily connects to your device on first try and never had issue with dropping connection.. (if you’ve had this angst before- you know how annoying it can be!) lights are a total perk.. fun flare and why not! Can be used with/without. But note: Music seems happier with lights. Ha ha!!<br /><br />Nothing but positives- this does exactly as it says and does it well. Without hesitation I’d recommend for anyone who likes a little boom.. earplugs for mama optional! Hoping info can help make your decision- stay safe everyone.",positive,positive
B007RNCLBY,5.0,"The LOGITECH SOLAR KEYBOARD FOLIO is easily the best of the three Bluetooth keyboard products that I've tested.  (The others are the [[ASIN:B004YIZXEC iHome Bluetooth Keyboard for iPad 1 and 2 and iPhone (IH-IP2101)]] (no case, about $40), and the [[ASIN:B007C0Y8NQ Targus Versavu Keyboard Case for the New iPad (3rd Gen), Wi-Fi / 4G  Model 16GB, 32GB, 64GB THZ17101US  (Black)]] (padded case, about $70).)  Setting up the FOLIO is a snap:  you slip the iPad into the flexible silicon easel tray, move the easel  to the ""Type"" position, turn on your iPad's Bluetooth, and let the iPad find the Folio's keyboard.<br /><br />The Folio converts your iPad into a ""netbook"" with an almost full-sized keyboard.  The keyboard is virtually noiseless, has a pleasant, soft ""touch"" for typing, has the usual specialized function keys (including a volume key), and is big enough to easily accommodate my large hands.  The easel has two comfortable viewing positions, one for typing and one for media viewing.  The Folio offers full scratch and screen protection for the iPad, as both the front and back of the iPad are covered.  The Folio is extremely slim and lightweight-- good points, in my view--but there is NO padding to protect your iPad from jarring or other mishaps.  Whenever you like, you can easily remove your iPad from the Folio's silicon easel tray.<br /><br />The Folio's Bluetooth keyboard is powered by the solar cells on the front of the case.  To fully charge the batteries, you place the case face up in a well-lit room for about six hours.  To check whether the batteries are sufficiently charged for keyboard use, you press the ""Battery Status"" button on the side of the Folio.  A LED light will blink once in green if you have an adequate charge, once in red if you don't.  No light means your batteries are dead and must be recharged, using the solar panels.  (At first, I thought that my Folio's batteries weren't charging, because the ""getting started""  booklet made me expect a steady green LED light when the batteries were adequately charged.  An excellent chart on the Logitech web site, under the question ""What does the LED mean on my tablet keyboard?"",  cleared up my confusion.)<br /><br />Without fail, the Folio turns my iPad 2 on and off when I open and close the case.  (The iPad general setting for ""iPad Cover Lock/Unlock"" must be set to ""On"".)  When I open the case, the LED light blinks briefly until the iPad finds and connects to the keyboard.  When you turn off Bluetooth to save iPad battery power, your iPad will find the Folio keyboard again without difficulty when you turn Bluetooth back on.  (The Folio only connects when the easel is set to ""Type"" or ""Media Viewing"" position.)<br /><br />The only thing that I don't love about the Folio, is that you have to be quite careful when closing it.  The edge of your iPad must be in front of the little ""roll bar"" at the Folio's spine, or else the cover won't fully close (and a hurried, careless, forceful closing could damage your iPad screen).  Because this lightweight case adds an excellent physical keyboard to my iPad while adding minimal weight and bulk,  I rate it at 5 stars (""I love it"" on the Amazon scale).  This is the iPad case that I will be using in the future.",positive,negative

B07JK2MBHT,3.0,"In the age of electronics, we all need more ways to plug ourselves in and manufacturers know this. They have responded by added usb ports and regular outlets to everyday appliances and this added convenience was enough to convince me to get the Seealle Bedside Desk Lamp with USB Fast Charging Port and Outlets Power Strip.<br /><br />This lamp requires a small amount of assembly out of the box. The assembly is simple, but it takes longer than it should due to the way they pack everything into the box. I know they do this to require as little space and as small of a box as possible, but the way the shade is inverted with the base stuck inside it takes effort to get loose. I was extra careful and avoided damage, but many people will not be so lucky.<br /><br />Once assembled, you just need to screw in a light bulb, screw the shade in place, and set the lamp on your desired table. My wife needed a night light for evening book reading, so I placed the lamp on her night stand. She likes having two places to plug in her phone, and the added light is nice for reading. There is a master switch on the cord and this provides another way to turn everything on and off, including the outlets. Another switch on the side of the base also controls the outlet. This is why, when you plug something in, you need to check to make sure it is charging. If it isn’t, then there is a good chance that one of the switches is in the off position. The light can be turned on/off using either the switch on the cord or by pulling the vertical, hanging metal cord underneath the light bulb.<br /><br />This small light looks good on a night stand, but it is slightly smaller than expected. It also seems rather delicate and due to the darkness of the shade, it may not produce the level of light you need. I find it fine as a bedroom nightlight because we don’t want it to be bright in this type of setting anyway, but other people might find that the shade makes everything too dark.<br /><br />It’s always good to have extra outlets and lamps with added outlets are commonplace nowadays as manufacturers answer customer needs. I like that this light has two added outlets, but the lamp is small and I still cannot get over the effort it took to dislodge the inverted shade from the base when I pulled the lamp out of the box for the first time. So, when all factors are taken into account, this lamp rates as average overall.",positive,negative
B004HKIIFI,5.0,"This is an Asus Eee Slate EP 121-1A010 update; we've changed the rating from ""Like it"" to ""Love it"" and we're adding a couple more to the office.  I chose it for a gastroenterologist friend who needed it for her medical practice. Now that patient records need to be digitized, she uses this tablet to keep track of all her business's management needs, which include patient vitals, records, and billing. In the doctor's own words:<br /><br />""I log into Athena, which is our electronic medical record and practice management, and then all the info regarding a patient gets put in.  So, the girls will use the tablet to populate BP, pulse, etc, past medical history, chief complaint, etc.  Some of it is clicking onto specific fields and it will auto-populate with a touch.  I think the ASUS Eee Slate is the perfect size screen by the way.  I really like that one.  The Acer (an alternate tablet which we tested) is good but, screen is small so it's difficult to maneuver over fields.""<br /><br />The doctor had been advised to get a Windows tablet and the ASUS fits the bill. She tried it and an Acer tablet so that she and her staff could get the feel of two different products. The Acer is considerably less expensive, has less memory, and lacks a few features that the Asus has. We had hoped to get tablets with the anticipated Windows 8 that MS announced around March 2011, but by August 8th, the anticipated release date was 2012. Failure to comply with new federal laws for digitized medical records means incurring penalties, so she wanted to have everything by September, hence these two touch tablets seemed to be the best choice as of August 2011. After nearly three months of use, it became clear that the Acer couldn't meet her needs, but the ASUS has been wonderful.  The doctor and her staff can download medical templates and macros directly from her provider, Athena Health, onto a main computer or the tablet.<br /><br />While her medical staff handles the initial patient consultations, the info can be transfered to or from a tablet into the office's mainframe computer, athenahealth.com, and to the doctor's own tablet via e-file or e-mail. They no longer need to transcribe handwritten information into the office's computer; it can now be done on the spot, saving time. The tablets can also be used to read Kindle books.<br /><br />The ASUS has the added advantage of a wireless Bluetooth keyboard and a digital pen, which I believe can be an asset for anything that requires a signature, e.g. a prescription or an MS Office Word business letter. It also interfaces well with a wireless printer, but it does have USB ports.  The ASUS also comes with a mediocre MS Office program that can be upgraded for a better version.<br /><br />My initial favorites were the Apple iPad2 or a Toshiba tablet. However, neither of them comes with a Windows operating system (OS). Toshiba uses Google's Android (aka Droid) and Apple uses its own system. While you can change Toshiba's OS to a Windows OS, I wouldn't recommend it if you're not technically savvy.",positive,negative

B01CGGOUJM,4.0,"In comparison to my Toshiba Satellite 15&#34; with similar specs, this ASUS is about equal - there are definitely some things I like better about the ASUS for everyday use and a couple of small quibbles that bother me. First off the computer itself is about the same weight as my Toshiba so carrying it around is exactly the same and it fits in my existing laptop sleeves and bags. It does have a DVD tray so you can play movies & music and burn discs as needed (as does my Toshiba), but a lot of laptops don't offer this anymore, so this is a definite plus.<br /><br />I do really like that the ASUS comes a lot cleaner out of the box than my Toshiba - almost no bloatware pre-installed. The basic Windows 10 and you can don't have to spend 30 minutes messing around with a bunch of garbage you don't want and won't use anyway. Additionally, the ASUS boots up about 20 seconds faster from off than my Toshiba and again from the sign in screen, the ASUS is still faster. The screen is very pretty and clear with a variety of images and video - keep in mind that it's NOT a touchscreen. I've been averaging about 6 hours of use with the battery before it hits the 30% mark - that is net surfing, watching some random videos, and mostly word processing. Leaving it on in sleep mode with no use - it went almost 4 full days before needing a charge. The wifi connects immediately and I've had zero issues with it dropping out either inside or out on the back deck.<br /><br />I really like the keyboard and the overall shape of the frame on this particular laptop. My Toshiba has the keyboard just open and exposed and what happens is that the heels of my hands tend to slip upwards as I type or bump the space bar. Or my thumbs slide into the mousepad area and now my cursor has bounced someplace new & I'm typing in the wrong spot. The ASUS keyboard is slightly lowered and has a border around it - for me anyway, this design is MUCH easier to type with. (See the photo.)  The shape of the overall frame is better on the ASUS than the Toshiba as well. The rounded corners and edges on the ASUS don't poke into your wrists after an hour of writing or research.<br /><br />My quibbles seem small on the surface, but after almost three weeks of use, they are aggravating me. First - the ASUS doesn't keep time as well as the Toshiba. It's off by 2 full minutes. (See the photos) I've checked both a couple of times and set them manually at the same moment and within 24 hours, the ASUS has lost 2 minutes - it never loses more than that though. Second - The charger is smaller than every other one I have for the other two laptops and the Chromebook in this house. The other three are standard size, but the one on the ASUS is a tiny bit smaller and thus you can't use another charger for this laptop in an emergency.  Third - the speakers on the ASUS don't sound quite as full as the ones on my Toshiba. Of course... no built in speakers on a laptop are really meant for full music enjoyment.<br /><br />My bottom line is that at this price point, this is a nice machine and will do almost anything you can want with regard to basic internet surfing, movie watching, office work and the like. This is not a gamer's computer and it's not meant to be. But as a regular, go to every day laptop, it's a pretty good one. I want to give it 4 1/2 stars.",positive,negative

B07MHJ28YM,5.0,"These earbuds combine incredible sound in a stylish and functional package.  I would give these more than 5 stars if I could.  I had high expectations before trying these, especially in view of the price, and these earbuds blew those away.<br /><br />Bang & Olufsen's engineers magically crammed a high-end sound system into a lightweight, wireless earbud.  You have to hear them to believe how amazing these sound - clean, clear music across an impressively wide range.  I noticed details for the first time in songs that I have heard many times before.<br /><br />Beyond the sound, the craftsmanship and overall product design are outstanding.  I don't know about the electronics as only time will tell, but the earbuds and the case themselves look like they will hold up to regular use without any issues.  The leather and brushed aluminum on the case adds an extra-premium feel to the product.<br /><br />Also, at first I thought the charging capability of the case was a bit gimmicky, but I quickly realized my error.  It is so convenient to know that the earbuds are fully charged whenever I want to use them.  I don't have a Qi charger, so I haven't taken advantage of the full wireless capability.  But for me, it is not a big deal to use the USB cord when I need to occasionally charge the case.<br /><br />To give some context, this is not a product I would have considered purchasing on my own.  I've always thought of earbuds as cheap, portable ways to listen to music while working out or on the go - situations where the background noise means that you can't appreciate high-quality sound.  However, after jumping at the chance to try these, they have completely changed my perspective on what earbuds can do.  Excellent sound quality is available in a highly portable, convenient product.<br /><br />The only downside I have experienced is that the touch controls take some time to get used to.  I had trouble figuring it out at first, but after a few days I can usually get them to do what I intend to do on the first try.  I prefer the minimalistic design, so this learning curve is not a significant issue for me.<br /><br />I also like the Bang & Olufsen music app that allows selection of different listening modes that vary between - ""warm"", ""excited"", ""relaxed"", or ""bright"" sound profiles.  Switching between the modes really gives the sound a different character.  My favorite feature on the app, however, is the ability to select ""transparency"" of the music.  A higher level of transparency amplifies your surroundings so you can hear what is going on around you.  This does not give you spy-gadget levels of hearing, but it noticeably amplifies background sounds.  I've been using these headphones at work, and I can easily hear when my phone rings or when someone knocks on my office door.<br /><br />Last, the excellent sound quality carries over to phone calls.  I have no trouble hearing the other person on the line, which is not always the case with the built-in speaker on my iPhone. Also the people I have talked to have had heard me clearly. This was an unexpected bonus, and I actually prefer to use the earbuds for calls now.<br /><br />TL;DR: If you can afford these, you won't regret it.",positive,negative

I can't even tell you how hard it is to find a modern radio with Android Auto / Car Play support that doesn't rely on touch screen buttons!<br /><br />That being said, it has some issues. As you can see in the video attached, sometimes it takes more than one touch to navigate the touch screen options. A more annoying issue, however, is the AM radio. You can't pick a station that ends in a zero! So stations like 550 which we wanted to listen to, simply CAN'T be tuned in! Even if you try to manually type it in, for some reason the dial pad starts reducing available numbers as you pick, as if they don't WANT you to be able to pick a zero as the last digit. It's very strange!<br /><br />I'd say for the user experience it should be 3 stars, but I'm adding a 4th because it's kind of rare to find a radio like this that fits in the space it does and offers these features. This Ford truck had a busted radio from the 90s, and this is a VERY welcome facelift and upgrade. I really like it and think for the price you're getting a lot of functionality. Of course you can't expect the polish or audiophile sound quality of a Pioneer or Alpine head unit, or even the mid-range quality of something like an Atoto, so for the price considering how unique of a product this is, plus the included camera, etc, I'd say it's a good value for a truck like this.

That being long windedly said they're beautiful however many lights they have. As mentioned I have them both in the same wall nook in my shower and when I take a shower at night I use only the simulated fire from the two lights and it is awesome. The two speakers will sync into a stereo configuration very easily. Just sync once each and then turn them on. The speakers have decent sound as long as you remember they're small drivers running 5 watts each. More than enough for a shower, bedroom or out on a deck or patio for a small party.<br />About the only thing I don't like about these units are the white rim ring light and button lights for vilume, power, changing songs stay on the whole time and they're quite bright. I understand that you'll need to find the control buttons but the bright white lights detract slightly from the fire effect. They should either be orange/red to to match the fire effect LEDs or turn off after a short period of time. Besides that I really enjoy having these around. They hold a charge for weeks. Granted I only use them a few times a week for showers but I've never run them out of charge I end up thinking I should charge them because it's been a month or more since the last time they were charged.<br />Fun, entertaining light with a decent speaker, can be paired into stereo configuration. Good stuff.",positive,positive
B08BJB2K7L,5.0,"My Insignia tv speakers are in the back. This is a problem when either the ac or heat turns on. Surround sound was too bulky for me, especially with my cats, so I tried a soundbar. This one was $40 with rave reviews, so I tried it. It was very easy to install with the good instructions. I used the optical cable. I can finally hear my tv. The remote immediately synced with my tv remote. I do have to turn the volume up every time I turn it on, but that's fine.",positive,negative
B0863FR3S9,4.0,"I've heard a lot of wonderful things about the Sony noise cancelling sets like these, and let me tell you: it isn't just hype. The sound quality is excellent, and the noise cancelling is eerily amazing. I put it on my wife and kids with the noise cancelling off and then turned it on to demonstrate, and you can see each them suddenly smile like ""whoa"".  Like my Sony studio headphones I use professionally for work, the actual fidelity of the sound it reproduces is excellent, and the microphone for calls is excellent despite being up by my ears and so far from my mouth (other bluetooth headphones I've tried were good for music only, the mic being up by my ears wasn't good enough to isolate my voice from ambient sound, but this definitely does a great job).<br />The app gives a ton of control beyond what I expected to really customize the experience. For example, I have mine set to auto-pause if the headphones are removed, and to turn off noise cancelling when it detects me speaking to someone, and then resume playback when the headphones are removed/replaced. These features are all customizable, as well as many more. But you need the app. And this is where the cons come in:<br />1) You really need the app to get the most out of this. I was thinking about pairing this with my desktop and/or TV, but without the app you have far less control, and to be honest I couldn't even get it to pair with my phone using just Bluetooth alone. There seems to be a way according to the instructions, but I couldn't figure it out without using the app installed.<br />2) For a set that costs this much, I'm surprised at how scuffed up it got after one fall from about 3 feet next to my car. Including pictures. This happened the day I got it. I'm not sure if there's anything that can be done about that, pavement is hard to recover from if anything is dropped, but it's something to keep in mind if you're spending this much money on a gadget. My studio headphones have been roughed around for years and held up fine.<br /><br />All in all, I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't so reliant on the app to get the features going and/or more resilient to being dropped. Feels like I should deduct one for that. But as far as features and sound quality go, this is a solid 5 out of 5.",positive,positive
B0189XYW08,5.0,"The 10&#34; is great for movies and reading things that begin with small type and need to be enlarged.

The larger screen solves that problem. The picture is clear and the it sounds better with the 2 speakers.

B072RCDN7T,5.0,"I picked up one of these mice on sale about a year ago.  I love it.  The battery lasts well over a month (despite the fact that I never turn it off).  I love that it can be connected to up to 3 devices and the Unifying Receiver compatibility.  I work in an IT office and we have displays that need to be restarted from time to time - having a receiver in that device makes it so much easier to login from my desk.  I love the fact that I can remap the buttons on the mouse and find that I do use them more than I expected.  Plus the scroll wheel settings are not just functional (the continued scroll and the ability to turn on and off clicking), but also satisfying.  I would definitely recommend this mouse, especially if you can get it at a discount.<br /><br />If I could fix one thing it would be bluetooth.  I rarely use this (or my logitech keyboard) over bluetooth on my laptop.  I find that it frequently needs to be reset leaving me scrambling to find a wired mouse and keyboard to log back in and reconnect the devices.  I think this is an issue with my laptop or WIN10 more than an issue with the mouse since this happened with other brand devices as well.  My ipads don't seem to have any issue saving and recalling the devices when they attempt to connect.",positive,positive

It provides peace of mind as the thieves seem to be getting more numerous and bolder & bolder. Recently,  using the speaker function, I was able to question/chase away some Dude who was literally dumpster diving in our neighbor’s big trash bin. He wasn’t just picking up roadside discards. With identity theft so prevalent, I worried he was looking for personal information. I was able to challenge him while safe inside our house. I said I was calling the police and he quickly left. I wouldn’t have felt safe going outside to confront him.<br /><br />I love that the notifications come on my Apple Watch. So easy & convenient since I don’t tend to carry my iPhone on me.<br /><br />The floodlight camera is also great for knowing when/where packages have been delivered so one can retrieve them before the porch pirates grab them.<br /><br />However, the greatest pleasure is seeing all the critters who come through at night. Before the floodlight camera, who knew? One night there was even a pair of coyotes! Cool!<br /><br />I want to add one in the back but the price has gone up by $30!

B00T7L96VW,4.0,"I received this is a free review sample. For the price this is a bargain, but there are two things that kept me from giving it five stars. First is this does not use a standard micro USB style cable for charging.  That means that unless you can find an easy source of cables with USB A on one end and the barrel connector this one has on the other, you are stuck with a three foot limitation of cable length. I have USB micro cables that are double that, and would have made this light all the more useful. Also, since I am using this as a music stand light if I misplace it for a gig I am out of luck because I do not own a similar charging cable (although I always have spare USB micro cables in my gig bag.) If you intend to use this as a fixed table lamp the cable issue will not be the problem for you that it is for me.<br /><br />Second, the gooseneck is sensitive. If I bump a music stand with this light clamped to the shelf it will move far out of place. It's not stiff enough to hold if you do plan to use it with a music stand. For tables, bed stands, etc. it should work fine, though.<br /><br />Here are some of the strengths: the lowest setting of illumination is perfect for stage use or if you want to read in bed without waking your partner up. At the highest setting it is definitely bright when lose in (about 1.5 meters), and - as Goldilocks said - the medium setting is just right.<br /><br />Another feature is untethered to the charger this will operate for three hours at the brightest setting and half more than double that at the lowest. That means that if you are camping, on stage (or in front of a lectern) without a power source nearby you can still use it.<br /><br />Finally, the included wall wart has a 2 Amp port for phones and tablets, as well as a 500mA port for charging this light. That is handy and all the more reason why the cable style for this lamp is a frustration - it could have easily been a five star product, and especially at the going price.",positive,negative
B004YIZXEC,4.0,"This iHome Bluetooth Keyboard arrives already charged, which makes it a snap to set up.  To use with an iPad, you just (1) switch the keyboard on, (2) press the ""connect"" button, (3) use iPad Settings/General/Bluetooth to find the keyboard, (4) click on the name of the found keyboard, and (5) enter the code that pops up.  (The keyboard requires iOS 4.0 or later to connect to an iPhone 3G or iPod Touch.)<br /><br />The featherweight keyboard is quite reasonably priced.  It's a little smaller than the keyboard on my Toshiba netbook (3.5"" rather than 4"" high, 9.5"" rather than 10"" wide).  Because I have large hands, my fingers are somewhat scrunched up, but I was able to adapt quickly.  The keys are flat-topped, rather than contoured.  There are the usual ""hot keys"" that wake the iPad, go to the Home screen, adjust the volume, do fast forward/back, go to the Search screen, etc.  The keyboard goes into sleep mode automatically after 15 minutes of inactivity.  A USB charger cable is included, so that the keyboard can be recharged by plugging it in to a computer (or into an AC outlet if you have an adaptor).<br /><br />This keyboard does not attach to the iPad, a case, or anything else.  I like having a free-standing keyboard, because I can place it anywhere that's comfortable for typing, well away from the iPad itself.  The keyboard is molded so that it is angled slightly upwards when placed on a flat surface, and it has nice rubberized grippers that keep it from sliding around on my desktop.  A black, velvety-textured, drawstring carrying bag is included to protect the keyboard in transit or in storage.<br /><br />Quality control could be a problem with this keyboard.  Mine had a loose area at the lower right corner, which made the keys in that corner rattle.  However the fix was easy:  pressing down firmly between the keys settled the corner under the clip that was there to hold it in place.  I like this keyboard a lot, and will be using it regularly with my iPad.  I rate it at 4.5 stars, rounded down to 4 stars because of the quality control issue.",positive,negative

B078J96YL2,5.0,"I'll be honest, I was expecting this to be another cheap off-brand mouse. I'm pleasantly surprised at how good it is- It looks pretty great, and rather than being covered in shiny fingerprint-magnet plastic like most cheap mice, a majority of the surface is textured (almost like a rubberized plastic). The USB receiver fits inside the body of the mouse for storage, which is great for travelling with it as I do. I've owned other mice that did that before too (an old Logitech), but unlike that old Logitech, this one uses a built-in rechargeable battery. To be honest, my Logitech mouse was great but after a couple of years the battery started making a bad connection inside (corroded contacts were keeping the battery from working), so I'd have to try to clean it off every few uses on the road to keep it working. With this product however, it seems less likely that will become a problem. Also, the ability to plug it in and charge it off the computer directly if it starts to die is a great plus!<br />My first impression was that the mouse was a little jumpier than I expected, but then I noticed the little button under the scroll wheel and discovered that it was for changing the DPI. Honestly, I'm not sure why they put it in such an easy to use spot, I feel like this isn't something that needs to change very often. But a couple of clicks on that button got me to about the mouse speed I like. I'm actually really happy with this product and although I was shopping around for a replacement Logitech, I think I'll keep this one in my travel bag instead!",positive,negative

B013G6TMUS,5.0,"I had been eying up the [[ASIN:B00B981XQC Ion Audio Job Rocker Bluetooth Portable Jobsite Sound System]] for a while. I was interested in a highly rated Bluetooth speaker because I had been using my [[ASIN:B00MPMK3GW Goal Zero 94014 Rock Out 2 Green Solar Rechargeable Speaker]] with my Google Nexus 7 since last year but was disappointed with it because that was the only device that the speaker would work with. I could not use it successfully with my HP OMEN Gaming Notebook or my boyfriend's iPhone 5 or iPad 3.<br /><br />I almost purchased the old Job Rocker but did not like that it did not have a USB port. Therefore, when I saw that this recently released Block Rocker IPA76C  was on sale at Costco for $119.99 plus tax, I purchased one immediately and I am thrilled that I did.<br /><br />FEATURES<br /><br />- This Bluetooth speaker pairs beautifully with my Nexus 7, my boyfriend's iPad 3 & iPhone 5, my BLU Life One 4G LTE SmartPhone that I use only as a portable tablet, and my HP OMEN. All I had to do was press the Bluetooth button on the speaker after I activated Bluetooth on the devices.<br /><br />- There's an auxiliary cable with stereo 3.5mm (1/8"") input that can be used to connect a CD or MP3 player and such to the unit.<br /><br />- A microphone is supplied with volume control.  At first I had trouble getting the MIC to work but once I turned off Bluetooth, it worked okay. It's not a great microphone but good enough.<br /><br />- There's AM/FM radio with 6 presets and a ""rubber"" covered antenna.<br /><br />- This Block Rocker can be paired / linked with another one for even more amplified power.<br /><br />- There's an On/Off power switch in the back.<br /><br />- It has wheels, side carrying grips, and a luggage handle making it portable enough to roll it around like luggage.<br /><br />- There are two 5V 1A USB ports for charging devices. I charged my phone with this port.<br /><br />- When not connected to a wall outlet via the supplied power plug, the internal battery is rated at 75 plus or minus hours of battery life depending on conditions associated with temperature, age of battery, and volume usage of the speaker.<br /><br />- The manual also says that it can be left plugged in indefinitely and it will not damage the battery (for those like me, who are not planning on taking this to a job site or garden party).<br /><br />I'm truly impressed with the sound and functionality of this speaker; so impressed that I am tempted to buy another one. In addition to home use as a theatre producing surround sound experience, this would also be great for outdoor parties and construction sites and such where there is limited or no electricity.<br /><br />I will update this review if I experience any issues but so far it's WONDERFUL!  As I was leaving Costco, one of their employees said I was going to love it as he purchased one the day before. Also, at another Costco today, they were sold out when I went looking for another one.<br /><br />In the comments section of this review, I attached a link to someone else's great video review on this product.

B07FHHL862,2.0,"UPDATED REVIEW REDUCED TO TWO STARS JUNE 2019<br /><br />We've had trouble with the remote for three months now. It works sporadically at best and has finally died entirely. This is a major problem because you cannot do important stuff with the sound bar without the original remote control. Such as.... rebooting it. If you change your WiFi network like.... getting a new router, then you cannot simply go to the app and update the connection. You must reboot the entire sound bar via the remote control only. WHICH DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. This design flaw has rendered the entire sound bar none functional because it cannot connect to the new Wi-Fi - going back to our old router isn't an option because it died. So now I have a sound bar that technically is operational, yet cannot be used. Our Bose 500 sound bar was able to be reconfigured for the Wi-Fi swap because it's remote works like a champ - it's also significantly simpler in design than the 700 remote. (I'll end up spending fifty bucks for a new 700 remote and that really aggravates me)<br /><br />******* Original review before the drama*******<br /><br />We've had an older Bose Solo 15 Series II TV Sound System in our living room for a couple of years and we've been pretty happy overall. I recently put the Bose 500 version of this sound bar in our master bedroom and was amazed at the difference, so getting this 700 for the living room was a no brainer. I mostly just expected them to connect as a group and have the same sound, but this 700 is better than the 500.<br /><br />It's a long, narrow, sleek looking unit with glass finishes that makes it almost invisible in front of the Tv.  Our Roku fits alongside without drama. The connections are via digital optical cable or the HDMI. Just turn off your TV speakers - not mute, off from the tv settings. You need to use the included wired headset to fully set the speakers for your room's accoustics. I'm using this bar with a 55"", 3 years old, Sceptre dumb tv and a Room streaming stick - the connection was immediate and drama free.<br /><br />You must use the Bose app to get full functionality out of the sound bar. The app let's you connect two or more Bose speakers with the tech and use them all simultaneously as a group to play music or audiobooks etc. The app also starts the set up for the Alexa link and the streaming services like Prime, Tune In, Bluetooth streaming and others. You can also set 6 favorites as one touch launch options.<br /><br />Alexa works fine through the sound bar, but the response speed is noticably slower than through a regular Echo. I get a glitchy message saying ""This unit is unable to perform routines"" every time I say ""Good morning"". Good morning triggers a specific set of actions from Alexa to turn on our bedside lamps, the bathroom lights, turn off our porch lights,  give me the weather and then our daily news brief. Despite that glitchy message, every morning, the Bose performs our routine flawlessly.  It's weird, but not a big deal really.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent and immersive in multiple settings from music to a movie. The app let's you adjust the sound quality and balance with bass, treble and center. You can also set it for dialogue mode to enhance/clarify voices and reduce background noise - this is very handy for the news or a talk show. Take some time to adjust the settings for what your ear really likes and you'll be amazed at the fullness of sound and all the background details.<br /><br />After two weeks, I'm incredibly pleased with the build quality, looks, sound and full functionality of both the 500 and 700 units. The 700 wins out by a nose over the 500 for us because the sound is bigger, but mostly because the remote control is better. The remote lights up when you lift it and you can find the buttons instantly. I programmed our TV to the Bose remote and it controls the sound bar, channels up and down and power for both the tv and the sound bar. Bottom line is that I am now looking at buying another 700 for the master bedroom and moving the 500 to our guest suite so we'll have the full set.",negative,negative

B07WT3GLF8,4.0,"My desktop tower pc has 4 usb ports in front, all of which are in use. So I thought it would be nice to use this adapter to give me some extra usb connections. Sadly, that won't work too well on my computer. The usb ports are high enough that the adapter dangles in the air because its cord is so short. Our fourteen year old nerd has a laptop which would work much better with that short cord and so the adapter was passed on to him.<br /><br />One odd thing of note - I have a headphone set up that uses a usb charger. When I plugged that set up into this adapter, the sound through the headphones was noticeably higher and shriller than it was without the adapter. That was strange enough that I listened to the same song with and without being plugged into the adapter and the difference was very real and very noticeable. Why that is, I have no idea. I also don't know if that would affect sound quality when used with a streaming tv stick or other audio devices. Keep an eye on the other reviews as they come in here to see if this is a general issue or not.<br /><br />Other than the cord being too short and the odd effect on the headphones I use, this does seem like a good product. It really is plug and play and it does provide extra usb ports at a time when we are attaching more and more stuff to our various devices.

I am not sure why not since the gimbal upon which the VESA mounting plate looks as though it should allow it, but it doesn't,<br /><br />The clamp that mounts to the pole has a thick, anti-marring insert that will protect poles. It's also one of the reasons why this mount is so heavy - the construction is very heavy duty.  All of the tools you need are provided to mount this to a pole and adjust it. The four bolts that come with it are a bit on the short side, although they worked with my monitor (and you need to provide a screwdriver for those.)<br /><br />I am thoroughly pleased with this mount, especially since I almost purchased an [[ASIN:B001TMCVDW Audio2000'S AST420Y Portable Flat Panel TV/Monitor Stand with Foldable Tripod Legs]], but took a chance on this at the last minute. That decision saved me a lot of money and accomplished exactly what I wanted.",positive,negative
B07NC9XWG5,5.0,"We got this TV 3 days ago.  First:,unpacking  and setting the TV in place takes 2 people. Be sure to read the directions on the TV box.  We laid the ""face"" of the TV on the dining room table covered with a bedspread to make sure the display would not break-- the directions say to lay the face of the TV down to attach the stand legs.  Voila !  In less than 30 minutes the TV was ready to hook up.  We are amazed at the quality of the picture.  As my husband said, you can see every wrinkle, freckle and pimple on people .  Today we were watching a bicycle race, and we both felt like we were dizzy watching the motion !  That never happened watching any TV before.  The commands are very simple and displayed on the screen.  As others have said,  the most obvious setting to change was the picture .  For some reason the default is dark... but easily changed thru settings.  I am so glad I spend a the extra money to get the RU8000 , instead of the RU7100.  Reviews convinced me to spend the extra money.  Our old tv was 6 yrs old -  light years in electronic time.<br />BTW. Firestick TV , Roku , Cable TV and new wireless headphones  are attached.  You won't be sorry if you buy this TV",positive,negative
B009B8EAWQ,5.0,"You can read other reviews to hear complaints about Windows 8.<br /><br />This is an excellent piece of hardware for the price.  Without any upgrades, desktop graphics in Ubuntu are very snappy; I expected to have to install a separate video card, but see no need to.  The RAM is upgradeable to 16gb by adding two 4g simms (there are 4 slots; 2 are filled).<br /><br />The build itself is reasonable.  For example: There is no case fan, but the case is designed for one so it would be easy to add.  But, I see no need---the machine runs very cool (&lt;35C cpu temp at low cpu usage).<br /><br />There is one spare 5.25"" bay (e.g. 2nd DVD) and one spare 3.5"" bay (e.g. 2nd internal HD).  There is adequate spacing for air flow around the 3.5"" bays.  There is no mount for a front case fan, but I think the 3.5"" bay spacing is sufficient for low-to-moderate usage.<br /><br />This is an energy efficient machine.  I plan to keep it running 24/7 and am happy to see that it consumes 45-50 watts when idle-ish in Ubuntu (measured using a kill-a-watt).<br /><br />I was confused by the location of the DVD eject button: it's on the right side of the DVD bay.<br /><br />To enter the BIOS, press the DEL key repeatedly during startup.  If that doesn't work at first, try ""restart"" from Windows.  Try using a PS2 keyboard (purple circular connector).<br /><br />The machine uses UEFI.  UEFI is is common on new machines, but was uncommon a few years ago and is likely a reason why installing a different operating system is not as straightforward as one would expect.  Note that along with UEFI comes a different hard disk partition scheme: GPT (instead of the older MBR).  I had trouble installing Ubuntu, but was eventually successful.  Should be easier now since I helped isolate a bug in the boot-repair package.<br /><br />Reinstall tips:<br /><br />* From the BIOS, try disabling SecureBoot and/or FastBoot.<br />* If installing Ubuntu, start with the Ubuntu UEFI community documentation (not the older UEFIBooting page)<br />* If nothing else works, try enabling CSM (Compatibility Support Module), which should allow you to boot without UEFI.  Note that you'll need to revert your disk to using MBR---I had mixed success with CSM.<br /><br />The Motherboard is Acer AAHD3-VC.  The BIOS is American Megatrends Aptio.  I found that Tiger Direct's ""Specifications"" page had more useful details about this machine.",positive,positive

B01NGTRMNR,5.0,"What I wanted was something I could use to listen to tv/movies/music/audiobooks/NPR while doing other work on my desktop computer. The Fire Tablet fits the bill perfectly. The video is crisp and clear. The screen size works nicely for an old guy who's had cataract surgery and wears bifocals. Even the closed captioning I need these days is easily readable on this screen. The speakers are not master quality but are more than adequate for this non-audiophile. This is my first time using Alexa and I love how easy she makes it to get the news and weather before shifting back to Netflix. The whole thing integrates nicely with my Prime account. So far I've just begun to scratch the surface of the options available through Amazon. I wouldn't try to use this tablet to do any heavy computing. That's why I have a high-powered desktop. For the entertainment niche I wanted to fill though, this tablet fits perfectly.<br /><br />There are some glitches. At times Alexa will freeze up for no discernible reason. Netflix can stutter at times too. This on a new tablet with only minimal apps, used one or two at a time so I shouldn't be overloading it's capabilities. For someone new to Fire Tablets and Alexa, there is a bit of a learning curve. It's not too onerous though. In a short time I expect to be using this tablet familiarly. Every computer I've ever used has had occasional glitches and there is always a learning curve on a new device. So far I haven't come across any deal-breakers and I can whole-heartedly say I love my new tablet.",positive,positive
B00FB5IL7S,5.0,"I am not developed in the intricacies of depth and pitch and all that other stuff so I cannot comment on the quality of the sound.  The music sounds good to me through these headphones.  I like the fact that it folds up and comes with its own carrying case, this is the reason why I purchased these.  The case is a soft pull string bag, not a hard case.  Ear buds irritate the inside of my ear so I needed these type and I like them.  It doesn't squeeze my head, they are comfortable over my ears.  There is a note on the instructions that you are supposed to use this with smartphones and that there is no guarantee they will work on digital music players, and that the mic may not work on &#34;unsupported&#34; devices.  I took a photo of the instructions.  I didn't try the mic myself yet, but I only got this to listen to music and watch movies on long airplane flights.",positive,negative

B00L22FAS2,5.0,"I received this as a free review sample nearly a year ago and have been using it at least twenty times a month. I use it for carrying microphones, adapters and miscellaneous electronics I use when performing as a musician. For protection this is ideal, and the inside and outside zippered pouches make this even more versatile.<br /><br />It does an excellent job of protecting the delicate microphones and adapters that I store in it. I am not using the dividers as vertical separators the way they were designed. Instead, I lay them on top of the mics, and then store the cables on top. That arrangement is perfect, and the bag and insert are relatively light and sturdy.<br /><br />Close to a year of constant use is testimony to just how sturdy this bag is, especially considering the times it have been accidentally stepped upon. Since the canvas part is so sturdy I am guessing that the insert will probably last even longer. One of the reasons is the overall construction, though lightweight, is of the highest quality. I am betting that if this were used for its intended purpose of protecting a DLSR or other photo equipment it would do as great a job as it does protecting my mics and other items.",positive,positive

B079JSZ1Z2,4.0,"I had a Galaxy S4 for several years. It was suitable and did the job. . . mostly. I was having some battery issues and my phone wouldn't update past Android 4.4. I was running into apps that needed a newer version of Android. I could have bought something cheap but I decided to treat myself and found the blue Galaxy S9 on sale for a decent price. I have to say I'm loving this phone.<br />The 5.8"" Quad HD+ Super AMOLED screen is GLORIOUS! I run this is high performance mode with the brightness cranked up. Games, movies, even YouTube and TikTok videos look amazing. The curved edge I worried might be distracting but honestly I only notice in a couple games.<br />Sound is really good for a cell phone it has stereo speakers. Volume is more than enough.<br />Performance from the Octa-Core processor and 4GB of ram have not struggled to run anything I've thrown at it.<br />The camera is great. Maybe struggling a little in very bright light with a light colored subject. Otherwise, night mode gives great low light results. Video shooting is very nice with great slow motion results and a nearly unique super  slow-motion recording mode at a mind boggling 960 frames per second is a lot of fun to mess around with.<br />Battery life is good, I got most of a day is high performance mode and could easily extend it by cutting things back to save battery.<br />The fingerprint sensor is quick to unlock and easy to use. A trick I found online to improve performance of the fingerprint sensor is to register the same finger more than once. It really works like a charm.<br />The look is sleek and sophisticated though I'm protecting that glass  body with a nice Otterbox Symmetry case. The only real minor negative to the whole thing is this weighs more and is larger than my S4, a little hard on my hands and pocket but really, it's worth it.<br />I can't express how happy I am with this phone. I'm even buying props and things to use in creative videos and photo shoots.",positive,positive
B000X1Z1VY,4.0,"I found myself in the market to replace my Belkin IPOD armband (the Velcro began separating from armband). I knew that it would probably be cheaper to just buy another one, than to try and repair it. Afterall, it didn't have to be especially cute, but practical and functional. Since I am planning a family (beach) vacation for the summer, I PLAN to start working out (my motivation being a vision of me in a bathing suit). But I ALSO know that I need something else to motivate and inspire me....so listening to music or an audiobook will definitely do the trick. The Griffin Streamline appears to be perfect for my 3rd generation Nano. Believe it or not, I wasn't wrong or disappointed. The Streamline is reasonably priced, and definitely does the job. It even looks a lot like my first one (Belkin), with the exception that the portion that surrounds the face of the IPOD is framed by hard plastic. This is the only thing that I would warn the consumer about....over time, I could see the hard plastic that surrounds the face of the IPOD cracking. Anyway, I haven't had any trouble selecting or manipulating the IPOD. The only drawback is the fact that you have to turn the Nano upside down so that you can access the earbuds and charger. The Nano fits snuggly in the case and doesn't move. The armband is adjustable and comfortable. And because I don't really sweat, I don't think that I will have to worry about the condensation collecting, around or behind it. The pack is slightly padded and appears to offer just the right amount of protection. With the exception of having to flip the device upside down so that you can access the cords, for the price and for what I intend to do with this product, it is absolutely perfect.",positive,positive
B009WE65EA,4.0,"I've been testing this speaker system with my 10"" Samsung Galaxy Tab2 tablet which had no problems connecting to the speakers with and without the app from the Android store.<br /><br />Appearance:<br />Their product description calls this 'fun, trendy and modern'. But to be honest this looks, to me, like an appliance that fell out of my grandmother's 1950's black, white and chrome art-deco kitchen. It's not unpleasant looking but I wouldn't call it modern. When I saw images of the system online I had hopes that the neon green ring around the face would light up. Sadly it doesn't. The handle is also fixed in place and doesn't retract or collapse into the body. It would have been a nice idea so you could stack or store this more easily.<br /><br />Sound:<br />It doesn't sound bad. Especially for being just two 15 watt wide range speakers in a ported (holes to help the bass sound better) enclosure. The bass is a little flat and the high end sounds a little... hollow but it is a lot better than the speakers built into my tablet. I've tried a variety of music; jazz, pop, classical, rock, punk and everything sounded quite good. I found I had to use both the tablet's volume control as well as the speaker systems volume controls to get real volume out of the system. They operate independently of each other.<br /><br />Drawbacks:<br />I don't normally comment on price with items received from the Vine program but at the time I'm writing this review Amazon is currently selling this item for over two hundred dollars. Maybe the Bluetooth equipment is expensive but to me that's a LOT for just two speakers in a box. I didn't pay that much for my four speaker bookshelf system or the subwoofer equipped speaker system connected to my desktop PC. Both of which have far superior sound quality.<br /><br />The battery indicator light only seems to light up when the system is charging. I charged this a week ago and used it for several hours at a time but I have no idea how much charge is left in the battery.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with this speaker system was when doing anything other than playing music. I thought it would be fun to add big sound to the games I enjoy on my tablet but there's a distinct lag between doing anything and when the speaker plays the sound. I noticed it most of all in my favorite billiards simulator. You would strike a ball...and then hear it happen, even system sounds such as keyboard typing noises, a 'blip' when selecting things played a noticeable time after they happened.<br /><br />The App:<br />I won't say much about the app here. It's completely unnecessary to operate this system with your Android device. It's just poor quality programming that appears to have been slapped together at the last minute. It also doesn't match the documentation and features such as Bass Boost which are in the instructions but don't exist in the app.<br /><br />Speaking of the documentation. I opened the box and found a large booklet and for one, brief, moment I thought this item was fully documented in depth and detail... then I opened the instructions and found there's twelve pages of English instructions which are poorly written and lacking in detail. The rest of the book is comprised of numerous other languages each getting their own few pages. Ah well. Turn it on, turn it up. Enjoy the music.",positive,negative

B09Y1L66CY,4.0,"I compared this cable with the optical cable I got with a SoundBlaster sound card, that I've been using to connect a Chromecast Audio to an external DAC, which pipes the sound into a stereo amp.  I played a Scarlatti sonata with this cable and the other cable, and can detect no difference with my ears.  (I don't claim this is a lab test, but with optical fiber at these short lengths and this limited frequency range, there really ought to be no measurable difference that would matter to human ears.)<br /><br />So I'd say these cables are just fine, and they're sufficiently well made that I'd have no qualms about using them.  I have to say though that I disliked the thick wrapping they gave this cable, as if the fiber were extra thick (that's a joke), or needed extra protection (it shouldn't need this much).  And this heavy braided wrapping makes the cable heavier and less flexible (as well as uglier!), so I'm taking off a point for it, since I can find other such cables that are superior.",positive,negative

B07594HZ6Y,1.0,"In full disclosure, I must admit that I miss my Bose Bluetooth speaker. Their acoustics are impeccable. The &#34;Tribit XSound Go Bluetooth Speakers&#34; only cost a fraction of my Bose speaker. I first purchased the &#34;DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth&#34; which is in the same price range; I returned that product because it lacked bass and was unimpressive overall. The Tribit, however, has plenty of bass for such a small speaker. Ironically, the problem that I have is the treble! I think it is an inherent problem with smaller speakers and not this particular device. I have installed an equalizer on my computer which mitigates some of the problems and makes the speaker sound very acceptable.<br /><br />The pros:<br />• The speaker is loud! It is perfect for a jam session in your bedroom. I'm not sure it is suitable for large or multi rooms.<br />• The quality is good, and the speaker looks like a million bucks.<br />• It has an excellent microphone that works well with phone calls and even to interact with Siri or Cortana.<br />• The Play button allows one to answer, reject or end a call. It also can play or pause a song. Finally, it allows you to skip a music track forward or backward.<br /><br />The cons:<br />• While the bass is fairly impressive, the treble is slightly overriding.<br />• The battery does not nearly last for 24 hours if you like to blast music as I do<br />• The speaker can only be paired to one device at a time. If you are listening to music on the computer and the phone tries to connect, the speaker will sometimes disconnect from all devices. The speaker does have an av input one could connect to the computer but obviously, the speaker would no longer be completely portable. This could be a deal breaker for many.<br /><br />After comparing this speaker with others in its price range, I realize that this speaker has such poor sound quality that I could never recommend it to anyone.",negative,negative

B07FQDMKFT,3.0,"UPDATE (2/21/19):  So far, my clock is working well.  I did buy a second clock, and succeeded in pairing it with my 1st Gen Echo Show.  If you make a pairing mistake, you can press the clock's pairing button 5 times to unpair the clock and start over.  Oddly, when the Show was correctly paired, the light turned solid orange.  The Echo Show is hard to pair because it isn't completely integrated with the Alexa app when it comes to setting up a wall clock.  However, for me, having two clocks, with visual timer displays paired to different Echo devices, was worth all the Setup hassles.<br /><br />This ECHO WALL CLOCK does two things that I really want.  First, it keeps accurate time by using an Internet connection (through an Echo device) instead of a radio signal (which can malfunction in bad weather or at Daylight Savings Time changes).  Second, it gives a bright visual display of the time remaining on all the timers currently set with my first-generation Echo.  (Yes, it simultaneously displays the time left on multiple timers.)<br /><br />If my clock continues to work without requiring frequent Bluetooth re-pairing (as other reviewers have reported), I will order a second clock to pair with my Echo Show.  The visual time-left display is very useful when I’m timing exercises or post-exercise ice treatments.<br /><br />The instructions warn you NOT to try to move the clock hands. (Other reviewers warn that touching the hands will break the clock, or cause it to tell slightly inaccurate time forever if you succeed in replacing the hands.)  It’s too bad that the clock does NOT have a plastic cover over the face--dusting it is going to be a problem.  I put mine on a wall, to protect it as much as possible from dust, and from accidentally being knocked over.<br /><br />SETUP PROBLEMS:  Out of the box, the clock paired effortlessly with my Echo Show (using the option of asking the Show to set up the clock).  However, I ran into a lot of difficulty when I tried to pair it with a second device (a first-generation Echo).  The instructions do NOT make it clear that the clock PAIRS WITH ONLY ONE ECHO DEVICE.<br /><br />Probably because I failed to start the second Setup attempt by using the Alexa app to un-pair the clock from the Show, the second attempt failed.  It ended with a green light that has no defined meaning in the paper or online setup instructions.  Worse, the clock no longer worked with the Show.  Still worse, the clock did NOT appear as a device in the Alexa app; and the app did NOT display the clock as a Connected or Bluetooth device under the Show settings.<br /><br />Eventually I found the clock under the settings for the Echo (subject of my second, failed Setup attempt).  I was able to unpair it, delete it, and start Setup again.  At long last, the clock paired with the Echo, and began working again (with the first-generation Echo).<br /><br />However, I failed in all attempts to use the Show to set up the clock again. Those attempts always concluded with a red error light or with that mysterious green light. At some point, I had to remove the batteries and replace them so that the pairing button on the clock would work.  Naturally I now dread having to pair the clock again with any Echo device, should the Bluetooth connection malfunction.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  The concept of the Wall Clock is great.  I love my clock now, and really do intend to buy a second one, if the clock that I now have continues to work normally.  However, I hope that later generations of the Echo Wall Clock will have a covered clock face, and that later versions of the Setup software will have much better integration with the Alexa app.",positive,negative
B07R88C8V2,2.0,"Pros: Cheap price, handles 4 inputs (would love to see more).  One of the [very few inexpensive options] to extract and output a pure digital audio signal (coaxial) rather than the lossier and worse standard- optical.  Basically does what it is supposed to do, which is rare these days. Remote control functionality works fine.<br /><br />Cons: Cheap.  Input/output ports are made out of cheap stuff.  Need to tweak a little to get the most out of it.  Spacing is tight like a manhattan studio.  The unit is lightweight and small so it shifts around when you have big cables.  Sometimes it gets lost and doesn't do what it is supposed to do- switch. In which case you just have to restart, but it doesn't happen very often.  Check video connection if there is an issue as well, which may prevent from switching.<br /><br />Putting it together:  All that being said, its great at this price doing what it is supposed to do, which is hard to say these days with all the ill manufactured things these days.  There is nothing out there that will do what it does- 4 x switch PLUS outputting audio via digital coax. At this price point its great for people who dont really care about maximizing the quality of their output.  For those who do, like me, not the best but its the only option at this point.  Id be more than glad to pay a bit more for a unit with quality input/output ports with a more substantial case.  Seems manufacturers these days think all people want are cheap products.  There are enough people out there who would pay a bit more for a more quality product.  They should consider a two tier product lineup- and not just for the functions.  Since there is room for improvement, it gets 4 stars.  Make some changes- Ill buy it, and assuming it works, it gets 5 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE: down to 3 stars.  Right at the 30 day mark, the one feature that differentiated this product from others- coax output, stopped working.  I did get it replaced and it works. This is somewhat expected, given the quality of material used and the price paid for something like this.  Another 30 days and this gets thrown out with the trash for good.  At least Amazon has a great policy to protect against something like this. So its worth a shot if you need these features.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: 2nd time it malfunctioned within a month.  Video stopped outputting.  When it works, its fine.  They really need to use more quality parts in this to make it last. Raise the price a few bucks if necessary. The parts themselves dont cost much.  Too much penny pinching.  This is getting ridiculous.<br /><br />UPDATE 3:  really save yourself the hassle, frustration and money.  Get a pro hdmi switcher.  It costs more BUT the output quality and just as important, build quality, is much better.  After switching over to a pro, I havent had a hardware issue in 3 months.",negative,negative
B003YSPQUY,5.0,"I loved these. They fit in without falling out. They have great sound. I purchased a $40 pair of headphones recently and they were awful compared to these. I will admit I am not a person who makes my living with music or is interested in much more than listening to music and books on my computer, iPod and iPad but these work and deliver quality sound. I love them more than any other headphone/earbuds I have ever had",positive,positive
B07JBNBT6H,4.0,"I'm not an ear bud fan. Neither are my kids, who often find them hard to keep in their ears at all. Sadly, its hard to find over-the-ear style headphones that aren't professional level expensive or Bluetooth these days. Sometimes you just want a standard set of 'phones for using on the plane or when connecting your set to different devices (don't get me started on pairing my bluetooth headphones with 4 different devices... it always just wants to pair with whatever I used last).<br />This is a fantastic budget friendly over-the-ear style set. They sound good, they are comfortable especially for younger ears, and they fold up to carry in a bag. The cable is also removable, which is nice. It comes with a cable that offers an inline mic with a TRRS plug on the end for use with a phone, but you can just as well swap that out for a standard 3.5mm end-to-end aux cable, making this truly a versatile pair of headphones for whatever you intend to use it with.<br />Giving it 4 stars because honestly, they aren't the most amazing sounding headphones and they don't have much noise isolation, but they sound decent enough to listen to music and movies and for the price it's hard to beat!",positive,positive

B09PYSNBDJ,5.0,"I selected this mouse as much for the cool factor as for the function. I needed a wireless mouse to use with a laptop and this one looked like a good fit. So far I have no complaints, but I do offer one word of caution with it.<br /><br />The most obvious thing about this mouse is the strange appearance. It doesn't resemble any other mouse I have used and at first it looks like it might be uncomfortable on the hands. On the contrary, though, it is quite comfortable and I have had no issues with it being too small for my hands even though it is a typical-sized mouse.<br /><br />I used with with my Windows 10 system and it works just fine. I have not tested it against my Linux system though I have no reason to believe it won't work - every other wireless mouse I have tried has worked without any trouble at all so I expect this one to be no different. If it proves otherwise I will return here and update.<br /><br />I ran into an immediate issue with this mouse - I could not find the receiver and as such I was unable to get it to connect to the system. It does not have any Bluetooth capability so that is not an option. As it turns out, the receiver was packaged in the box but was in a small plastic baggie separate from the mouse and when the box was opened to remove the mouse the receiver fell out, unnoticed. I thought I had been sent a mouse without the receiver until I finally realized what had happened and located the receiver. So, use some caution when taking this mouse out of the box.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this mouse. It works as expected and is more comfortable than it looks.",positive,positive

B088MNF7NK,5.0,"For my uses, these are great. They were very well packaged and secure for shipping. The box is very nice and sturdy, lined with foam. I need to hear the environment around me. This has been an issue with previous earbuds. Commercials between videos or songs can get so loud! That is the deal-breaker for me, as it's a safety issue. These do not get too loud, even on the loudest setting, so I am able to remain safe. I don't have an issue hearing the sounds coming from the buds, but I'm not in high-traffic outdoor areas regularly either. My ear canals are unusually small for an adult. I was afraid these may be too-big, but they are snug. Any bigger and it may have been an issue. I used the smaller of the plastic tips. Over the ear designs are the only ones that have ever worked for me. I did look at some other models in the past, but I found them a bit more expensive than I felt justified to spend unknowing how well they may work for me. However, knowing how well these work, I find them to be a really great value and would have purchased them before if I had known how well they worked. It was only by chance they were up for review and I had been seeking a replacement on my old pair that I've been using for the past few years.<br /><br />The Bluetooth is nice. I have a simple cell phone. It only took asking my phone to connect to work. It was the easiest that I have ever had with connecting anything Bluetooth to my phone. I liked this as I'm not the most savvy at using Bluetooth electronics. If I can do it, anyone can.<br /><br />I'm not great at using the buttons as they are really sensors on the flat-side of the body on the earbuds. I'm getting used to it but they are touch sensitive and there is a correct spot and amount of pressure that works best. I'm still getting a feel for it and there is a slight delay, so it's very easy to double-tap. The included booklet has been helpful to learn to  use these straight out of the package.<br /><br />Sometimes I get down on the floor at the gym to use the foam rollers and stretches, other times I'm using them in the car to take calls. I've tried them at work as well. Every scenario has worked well for me. I really do wish I've had these before. Sometimes while getting my breaks at work, I would want to listen to things from my phone, but didn't want to risk disturbing my co-workers with some of the news and hobby related videos I enjoy. I asked a few co-workers if they could hear my earbud noise, they could not.<br /><br />The case is very easy to use as well and fits easily into my pockets. I'm a lady, so my pockets are not always very generously sized. It charges very quickly, and I've not found myself running out of charge. I cannot speak on the long-term durability for this as they are new. If/when I experience any issues with the charge, I will be sure to post an update.<br /><br />In summary, these would be better for users that need to hear their surroundings for safety. For those that want extreme high volume, they may not be as happy. They stay on my ears securely and the case works very well. I'm pleasantly surprised how well I like these and hope that they are durable since they are working so well for me.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful.",positive,positive

This soundbar, just after using for a little while of use, has been truly phenomenal.  Also great for parties, or just listening to spotify / itunes music or movies. I can also watch movies on my phone and still get a full loud cinema sound. This device is very sleek, attractive and has a streamlined design. The only complaint I have is the sound volume control. It doesnt remember my last setting, so I have to adjust when turned on. Overall, This is an excellent product that I highly recommend to my friends if they needed one.",positive,positive
B0B14XR8FK,5.0,"Wireless headphones are great, but I have a love/hate relationship with using Bluetooth on a PC. When using the mic with headset profile for calls, the audio gets routed totally differently than regular stereo sound (A2DP), which gets confusing if multitasking and playing sound while also using the mic. And then there's the delay/lag etc that usually comes along with Bluetooth from a Windows desktop. But that's why I love the USB dongle here!<br />Plug the little USB bit in, and it detects the headphones like an alternate sound card, full blown crystal clear stereo audio, even if using the mic! And the mic can be extended or retracted, something I love since I lost the removable mic on my old headphones.<br />But, if I want to use it with my phone or tablet, I can revert to standard Bluetooth and connect that way on my Android devices. The price is a little bit steep, but the quality is there, this is a well designed and well made product that works as intended so far. I'm impressed.",positive,positive

B0049IYLOA,5.0,"This case is exactly what I wanted: extremely durable shock-absorbing (read: drop-proof) protection without screen protection. Let me qualify that statement: I did *not* want screen protection. I love the pearl eink display on my graphite Kindle Keyboard, and it now has a big brother. I do not want a screen cover, as this would greatly reduce the screen's otherwise remarkable clarity, adding unwanted elements such as bubbles, surface scratches, and glare to the mix--no thank you. There is a reason I disliked reading on the iPad so much I gave it back (very reflective!). In fact, this OtterBox defender case came with a stick-on screen protector--no way. It would ruin that big, glorious pearl eink display.<br /><br />A screen cover serves no purpose once you remove the device from your backpack/messenger/tote/briefcase for use. Assuming you transport your Kindle device safely in an appropriate sleeve (you put your other expensive electronic equipment--your laptop/tablet in one; your Kindle deserves the same amount of respect), the screen protector is completely unnecessary--the sleeve protects the screen during travel. THAT is when the screen needs protecting--when you are not using it, from the other goodies in your messenger bag/backpack (keys, pens, earbuds, and anything else rattling around in there). Yes, that's right--I'm talking about a Kindle in an Otterbox Inside a sleeve inside your briefcase. ...Inception-level protection. You got it. Better safe than sorry, right? What if they once again stop producing our beloved Kindle DX and something happens to yours? I do not want to have to replace my DX--especially if it has to be with a Fire device (5% the battery life, reflective, heavy, expensive--no thanks!). When you are holding your Kindle in your hand, reading, a screen cover only detracts from the experience.<br /><br />What you see in my pictures is exactly what you get: a beefy, black rubber (not silicone--too easily torn; rubber is much stronger) form-fitting sleeve with an equally form-fitting outer plastic shell. Science geeks like me understand how this works, and just in case you are not one, here is the idea: if you drop your device onto the floor, the outer shell absorbs some of the impact energy generated by the device hitting the floor. It then disburses the remaining energy of the impact broadly into the rubber inner lining. The rubber lining then in turn disburses the now greatly-reduced impact energy into the device. In other words, by the time the force of the impact is filtered through two layers of protection, the second of which is very absorbent and resilient (rubber) the device inside absorbs little if anything of the original impact.<br /><br />I feel very good about having my Kindle DX in an Otterbox Commuter. If I ever had one of those incredibly poorly-designed (read: seriously fragile) apple devices, such as an iPad or iPhone (which I do not, and am not ever likely to), it too would live in an OtterBox Commuter case. OtterBox = the best protection a device can get. I paid $18 including shipping for this. A great price, and worth much more in terms of peace of mind.",positive,negative
B004NBL9WK,5.0,"This device is a WiFi repeater. That means that it picks up your existing WiFi signal and rebroadcasts it to extend the reach of your network.<br /><br />I got this (and the [[ASIN:B004WPUHXO Amped Wireless High Power Outdoor 14dBi Directional WiFi Antenna Kit (AD14EX)]]) to extend my wireless network to my workshop, at the back of the yard, about 250 feet from the house. This is far enough away that I don't get even the smallest amount of the WiFi signal from the house. I wanted to watch TV while I work, and I also needed to be able to use a phone there. I could run Cat-5e wiring underground, but that would require digging a trench across the yard, and also running the Ethernet cable from the router inside the house to a demarcation point at the exterior of the house, which would be quite a bit of work. Using this repeater and antenna--two pairs of them, actually, the pair in the house and the other pair in the workshop--I'm able to get a very strong and fast network link in the workshop.<br /><br />It's incredibly easy to set up. The antenna is designed to be mounted outdoors, and they recommend using 25 feet of [[ASIN:B004WW5WAA Amped Wireless Premium Outdoor 25ft Antenna Extension Cable (APC25EX)]] to connect the antenna to the Smart Repeater. Instead, I connected the Smart Repeater directly to the antenna with the short cable that comes with the antenna, and both are sitting in a closet at the edge of the house. In the workshop, I have the Smart Repeater and antenna sitting on a shelf above my desk. I would probably get an even better signal if I mounted the antennas outside, but it works just fine for me with the antennas inside. In the workshop, I aimed the second antenna in the general direction of the one in the house, and it works great. There are a few trees between the buildings, and the signal still gets through.<br /><br />You use a Web browser to set up the Smart Repeater, and it's incredibly easy. It automatically scans to find your existing wireless network, and then lets you choose a name for the new wireless network that connects to the first. It took me about 6 minutes to set up, including 3 minutes for the device to reboot after configuration.<br /><br />Without doing anything to really optimize things, I'm getting 2.5 Mbps downlink, and about half that uplink. This is slower than my router's upstream connection, but it works just fine. For comparison, when I'm in the house connected directly to my WiFi router, I get 19 Mbps downlink, and 1 Mbps uplink. So I'm getting much less speed downlink, but all the available uplink bandwidth. I guess I'll go experiment with mounting and aiming the antennas better. But even with the reduced speed, I'm really enjoying having the network and phone in the workshop.",positive,negative

We've had water proof speakers before, but never one that could actually be put in the water and float around. We've put it directly in the hot tub and we've put it in the cup holders. What I really like about this is that there is all around sound. You don't have to position it with the speakers facing a certain direction just to hear it. You can hear it from all directions! The sound is pretty good, too. My daughter has used this in the backyard with friends and it was more than adequate. We have found it easier to control the volume with our phones than the actual device, but you can control it from the speaker, too. The light feature is fun at night. Our hot tub light bulb is out and needs to be replaced and this does the job for us. It was easy to pair with our phones. Overall, we are very happy with this new speaker!",positive,positive

You can indeed connect the soundbar to an Echo device *as a regular bluetooth connection*, but the instructions to enable Auto VA (auto virtual assistant mode) via Bluetooth so the soundbar maintains a BT connection with Echo while using other inputs DOESN'T WORK. The instructions say to first connect the soundbar to Echo via BT (✅), and then to press the Bluetooth button for 10 seconds to enable Auto VA (❌). HOWEVER; after five seconds, the soundbar enters Bluetooth pairing mode. I've tried dozens of times, connecting and disconnecting the BT connection with Echo and restarting and resetting the soundbar: NO DICE.<br /><br />It's frustrating because this feature is in the title of the product and is clearly described in the User Manual — and yet it doesn't work at all.<br /><br />I imagine Auto VA via AUX input works okay, but that means I have to move my Echo or get a wicked-long audio cable, neither of which I want to do.<br /><br />However, otherwise the soundbar sounds fine.

B07YVYNM3N,5.0,"The  1st thing I noticed about these headphones when I received them (other than the amazing box they came in) are that they are noticeably heavier than my other headphones. I take that as an indication of higher quality speakers.<br /><br />They do sound amazing. I listened to an album I have heard dozens of times before in the car & on earbuds & could hear elements I have never picked up on before. I actually thought I was listening to a different version of the song.  I expected an exaggerated bass like I get with some earbuds but the sound is straightforward.<br /><br />The noise cancelling seems about the same as my much cheaper headphone set but both are very good & make a world of difference on a plane or other noisy situations.  Pairing is practically automatic on Apple devices but it is also easy for my Android phone. I think we have 3 or 4 devices currently paired to this set.<br /><br />The headphones turn on as soon as they are unfolded. This is a cool feature but it means they are always on if they are worn around the neck. The battery lasts a long, long time. One charge played movies & noise cancelling for 7 hours of flying, probably another hour of music plus at least 4 more hours of just noise cancelling because someone forgot to close them until they were down to 2%<br /><br />The volume & play /pause are easily controlled by tapping the right ear cuff. The charge port is the robust Apple lighting cable type which was a surprise to me until my daughter told me that Apple owns the Beats brand.<br /><br />The carry case is much bigger than the folded headset. At first glance it doesn't look thick enough to provide good protection  but pinching the material reveals that it has a thin, soft layer of foam or something inside. The zipper is the waterproof type which is a nice. The case comes with a hang tag & carabiner.<br /><br />The headphones were too tight for my XL head. My ears were sore after long days on airplanes. I extended the cuffs all the way to reduce the tension  which helped a little but made them harder to wear. The ear cuffs are a little smaller than another pair I have & I like the larger cuff because I can move them around a little on the ear for comfort while still getting a good 'seal' on my ear.<br /><br />I ended up giving these to my daughter & she absolutely loves them. She is very is proud to have the Beats brand which isn't so important to me.",positive,positive
B07TQ71H5V,2.0,"EDIT:  Replacement battery went belly-up this June, about 18 months after installation. This was the second one the seller had given me. At least my daughter got a year and a half of use out of it before it stopped charging or turning on. I went to go remove it and oh my goodness, this battery was SWOLLEN. I'm glad I removed it when I did because I know what happens to Li-po batteries if this thing had burst. To be fair, she went away to camp and left it plugged in, so I'm not sure if this would have happened under normal usage. Be careful with your batteries and treat them well.<br />I don't think I can reach out to the seller now for a replacement 1.5 years later, but I wish I could say it lasted longer than that. Original review was 4 stars, reducing it now to 2 because the swollen part is alarming and I shouldn't have to swap batteries every other year like this.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:<br />It seems that the battery I received was not actually the stated capacity, after a few charging cycles is claimed to only have around 79% of it's life remaining. The good news is that the seller is excellent and replaced it ASAP. The new I have is still around 85% capacity, but to be honest for the price I'm happy with it. My old battery was much worse, so this is a major improvement and I can't complain much for the price.<br />If you want something closer to the original battery, you'll have to easily pay twice as much if not more.

I tried to solve the problem, and from the product's home page, I found that the side with the buttons on the speaker always faces up, and when facing the buttons, the speaker always hangs on the wall. When the position is adjusted, the sound of the speaker becomes louder, bluetooth has also become very stable. The sound is very clear when playing songs. Love it!",positive,positive
B073RQBYKS,4.0,"I wanted to be able to incorporate the Harmony Hub Extender with Harmony Elite remote into my existing Z-wave network, to control lighting. It was easy enough to pair it with the Hub and download new firmware to it.<br /><br />However, there was quite of bit of trial & error to get it paired with my Qolysys Z-wave panel. Many times it would not pair properly. And the Extender & Hub kept going offline, making it hard to do anything.<br /><br />So I read some advice online and did the following: (1) do a reset to factory defaults for both the Harmony Hub & Extender, (2) swap the power adapter for a fast charger, giving the unit a more robust power supply, (3) made sure Hub was connected on the 2.4 GHz side of my Asus Wi-Fi Lyra mesh system, (4) assigned a static IP address to the Hub, (5) added & removed the Extender several times from the panel and (6) not try to make the Extender a secondary controller of the Z-wave network.<br /><br />Eventually using the mobile Harmony app, the Extender started recognizing all of my devices. I can now reliably control lighting & the thermostat from the remote. It complements the control I have from the panel & the Alarm.com app.<br /><br />Was it worth the effort? Probably not. But got the Harmony Elite, Hub & Extender as refurbished units for half the price of new, so that dampens the frustration some.",positive,negative
B0109FMO9U,3.0,"I bought this stacking kit when I purchased the FiiO E12A Mont Blanc IEM Special Edition Portable Headphone Amp, Titanium so I could connect it to my FiiO X5 High Resolution Music Player (2nd Generation)(Titanium). It is easy to set up, but it sure is ugly once you get it on there. Some of you may like that - I thought it looked kind of cool, like a weird set of custom recording gear or something. But the rubber bands used to hold the headphone amp onto the back of the DAP were strange looking. They also get in the way of the E12A’s USB port, so I would have to scoot the bands out of the way when I needed to get in there. They got in the way of the X5’s volume keys too, but you won’t need to use those if you’re using a headphone amp.<br />I eventually broke the plastic frame on one of the cutaways for the rubber bands when I was trying to put my X5 back in. It’s thin in a few spots, and the plastic cracked. Instead of buying another one, I used some Command Strip Picture Hanging Strips (sort of like velcro, but without the fuzzy strip) to snap them together. It looks neater, and it’s easier to use.",positive,negative

B01IFNZQ16,4.0,"I received this as a free review sample. The reason why I docked it a star is the active tablet window needs improvement (and that could have been one of the stand-out features if properly designed.) Here is the problem: it's the perfect size for an iPad Air 2, but could not accommodate my Tab 2 10.1 inch tablet. It did hold my Samsung Tab Pro 8.4 (even in an Otterbox Defender case). The vinyl window wrinkles and also reduces sensitivity when you interact with your tablet.<br /><br />If the active tablet window is unimportant to you, then the rest of this backpack is a winner. Pairing my phone to the bluetooth speakers was as simple as flipping a switch and scanning for it on my phone's settings. And the speakers are loud with better than expected sound quality. I was pleased with that - some thought went into the speakers.<br /><br />The padding is more than ample for protecting electronics, and there are sufficient pockets for the geekiest geek. What I like, though, is the storage areas are not overly complex. I own a Booq bag that is a storage dream come true, but almost requires a photographic memory to remember were all of the pockets are. This one is designed much simpler, but still efficient and effective.<br /><br />Construction (except for the active tablet window) is first rate. The tablet window is marred by a difficult zipper, whereas all of the other zippers on this bag are sturdier and smooth.  The outer fabric seems tough (I have not had it long enough to make any claims beyond that), and all of the seams are reinforced, straight and tight.<br /><br />It's very comfortable and can be adjusted to evenly distribute the weight of a fully loaded pack.  Considering that the bag itself is somewhat heavy this is a major plus for me.<br /><br />I do want to note one thing about the backup battery: it is rated at (and stores) the full 4000mAh. However, like all batteries using this one's technology it's only 70% efficient, so expect about 2800mAh of usable capacity. That is not a flaw in this bag, but a reality that I wanted to point out so your expectations are properly set.<br /><br />Overall, this is a well made bag with some innovative features (battery back-up and bluetooth speakers). If the active tablet window is not an important feature it's definitely worth considering. This one will be replacing my Booq because the storage is there without the complexity.",positive,positive
B00OOEMLEG,5.0,"I am not going to repeat the product description, which is complete with regard to basic specifications and what this package contains. I am going to confine my review to personal observations and actual use of this camera. Note two things: I received this as a review sample, and I have not extensively used this camera. Thus far I have been using it for approximately a week, which is sufficient for basic functions, but not for long term reliability.<br /><br />This is a complete solution, down to an 8GB SD card and a pair of batteries that are included in the package. The main limitation with this camera is you will get about an hour of use for every three hours of charging. That is not bad for extreme type videos for which this camera was designed, but do understand up front that this is not going to replace a DVR or even your phone's video camera capabilities (depending on your phone) for regular video capture. Again, this is not designed as a general purpose video camera so I do not view that limitation as a detriment.<br /><br />The 8GB card that ships with this camera holds an hour of video at full 1080P 30FPS resolution. The camera will accommodate up to 32GB SD cards, and if you have an external battery pack like a [[ASIN:B00KX2DUU2 Lumsing® 4000mAh Ultrathin Portable Power Bank External Battery Pack Backup]] you can, in fact, capture up to four hours of video.  Using an external battery pack is probably not a good idea when trying to mount this for extreme sports videos, but will allow you to use this camera for more general purpose uses.<br /><br />One feature that I particularly like is the fact that this uses a regular micro USB connection for charging and transfer. I have a few cameras that use barrel connectors and they limit your charging options, so this use of standard cables is a plus.<br /><br />Note that his this camera has no options other than MOV files for video. I had no problems with that format on my Windows XP laptop and it's fairly common with both Microsoft and Apple environments, but not all applications that run on those platforms.<br /><br />Another feature that I especially like is this camera comes with just about every conceivable attachment that you can think of. If you are directly comparing this to a GoPro the value proposition of this package is apparent. I am not saying that this is better than a GoPro because that camera has become something of a standard, and also I do not have enough direct experience with that camera to make a valid comparison. What I am saying is if this camera will meet all of your needs and/or if you have a set budget this one offers more value. The real decision, though, is yours.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this camera and the video quality. It's reasonably easy to operate and is versatile for the uses for which it was designed. While I cannot credibly compare this to the GoPro I can compare it to the [[ASIN:B00NEYHIHM Polaroid POLC3 Cube HD Digital Video Action Camera Camcorder]], which I do own, and between the two this one is hands down the better choice. In the class of value-priced action cameras this one gets a solid five stars from be for both performance and value.",positive,negative
B001EYU3L2,4.0,"My husband and I bought two sets of these three years ago from Circuit City during their going out of business sale. We both travel quite a bit and were in need of decent headphones for longer flights (let's face it, the ear buds provided by the airlines just don't cut it). My husband accidentally left his set, in their pouch, in the seat back pocket on a flight last year and was in need of a replacement set for our trip to Germany last week. I was amazed by the price when I came onto Amazon to check - $29.99 was a steal compared to the $80 we spent a few years back! This headset is not the top of the line, but it is effective in canceling out the low aircraft drawl while in-flight. (They are also quite nice when you need to drown out the crying child in 23F. ;)) The battery life is remarkable. I have had to change the battery on my set only twice in the three years I've owned it. The only complaint that I have, which results in the four star rating instead of five, is that after wearing the set for a few hours (i.e., Amsterdam to Houston, TX), my ears begin to ache on the outside. It is almost like the headset becomes to tight over longer periods of time. I tend not to wear earrings on airplanes, so I can rule out the possibility of pinching. Other than that slight achy feeling, these are wonderful for the casual traveler and the price simply cannot be beat!",positive,positive

B018E0I01I,2.0,"*UPDATED REVIEW*<br /><br />A seller replaced a different defective FM transmitter unit with this one for me (mine has the Kollea brand name on it, but this is the identical unit, private-labeled). This is a better product than what it replaced, but is not without it's flaws. I have three (*UPDATE: now four, and the fourth one is a deal-breaker--see below) complaints with this unit:<br /><br />1) It will not automatically reconnect to my phone about 75% of the time. I have to manually shut Bluetooth off and turn it back on on the phone, sometimes a few times before it pairs successfully. This is a hassle--a PITA. Every time I get in the car, I have to go through this process--every time power is cut from the transmitter, actually, so if your passenger knocks it and it pops out of the 12V socket, it will have to be re-paired, which is supposed to happen automatically, but does not, and you then have to go through the process. Frustrating.<br /><br />2) Charge output is only 1.0A. this is why I returned the first one--phone gives a &quot;slow charging&quot; warning when charging from this unit, regardless of what USB cable I use (I tried four different cables, all of which I know for certain can carry 2.1A).<br /><br />3) Callers have occasionally complained they cannot hear me well when using this unit, and I occasionally (but not often) encounter FM interference. I believe Bluetooth itself is part of the problem, and anyone who has used a few Bluetooth headsets or units like this knows audio quality is terrible. Period. We just deal with it. Add to that the burden of having to transmit your signal via FM to a car stereo and the user-side audio (what you will hear in your car) is always going to be craptastic.<br /><br />4) (*UPDATE) When paired, voice recognition on my phone, which is usually quite good, becomes severely impaired. This is also likely the culprit for complaint #3, above. I suspect this is because when paired, it tries to use the built-in microphone for voice recognition instead of the microphones on my phone (of which there are 4). It is disabling the extremely good microphones in my phone (Nokia lumia Icon which is well known for having incredible audio input) and using the unit's crappy microphone instead. This microphone is located in the unit, which is attached to the center console of my car near the shifter, and thus picks up all the vibrations and related road and engine noise transmitted through the structure of the car as I drive. This approach is terrible. I have stopped using the unit for anything requiring voice input, including telephone calls. In other words, this is just a big awkward charger now, and one that charges painfully slowly (see complaint #2). If it were possible to disable the onboard mic, and use the mics in my phone instead for calls and voice recognition, this would be a much more serviceable unit As it is now, it is just a piece of junk.<br /><br />Cannot recommend this item. There are definitely worse products out there. I have not tried them all, but of those I have used, this is the best one so far. I will likely keep using it until the lack of automatic pairing pushes me over the edge with it one day and I get something else. (*UPDATE: this thing just does not work well, and I am now looking for something else.)",negative,negative
B078MHSGZN,5.0,"I don't know much about the technicalities about this laptop.  I have been using it and love it.  I have a great familiarity with Dell computers, so that recognition is helpful.

B09TNDLWHB,5.0,"I work in live AV production, and usually keep a pair of Sony over-the-ear headphones in my gear bag for monitoring sound on location. Quality of the sound is important for concert and other live music gigs. But those big Sonys take up a lot of space, so I've been considering a good set of IEMs for a while now. In the past I haven't had good results from anything that wasn't a large over-the-ear set, and I have small ears that reject a lot of ear-bud style devices so I was excited to get a chance to try these out.<br /><br />Ok, to be fair, I don't have any other IEMs to compare this to, but I'm BLOWN AWAY at how incredible they sound at such a miniscule size. I put on the smallest tips for my ears and they actually stay in relatively well, and create the passive noise cancellation I was expecting but without being uncomfortable to wear for an extended period of time. But the range of sound reproduced was something I have only experienced in larger studio headphones!<br />A perk of IEMs versus larger headphones on jobs like mine are that I can pull out one so I can hear the sound around me while monitoring with my other ear (great if working with an audio engineer who needs to communicate with me on the job), and it comes with a pretty nifty case to wrap it up and slide into my bag. The case makes it bigger than it needs to be, but honestly this is so much less space than my old headphones took up, and keeps the cord from getting tangled. I love it!<br />For personal use, they sound great even on consumer equipment, but they really shine on devices that can drive the additional range such as my old LG V20 with it's Quad DAC built in (one of the reasons I keep that old device around!).<br />The price tag is a little steep for me personally, but my Sony headphones retail somewhere around this (I had bought them used), and I KNOW there are pricier options out there, so it seems to fit right into the audiophile equipment range.",positive,negative

First I wanted a memory card that I could use in my [[ASIN:B00966PFHW Philips DVT1000/00 2 GB Digital Voice Tracer with 2 Built-In Microphones Voice Recorder]].  Second I also wanted to copy and store many photos from my laptop on this card.

What is also impressive is that this is so, so tiny.  I don't stay up on technology much any more, but if this got any smaller I would have to use a magnifying glass and tweezer just to remove the card from the reader and insert it into my recorder. The card has a nice indent in it so you can pull it out with your nail (that's if you have finger nails).<br /><br />I got this on gold box special for $26.99 instead of the current price of $68.24 and now I'm sorry I didn't buy two.

B0023B14TK,4.0,"The Flip is a pint-sized camcorder with a surprising feature set given its compactness. Though is it not a full-featured camcorder and I would not recommend it for serious recording (special events or production material), it is excellent for on-the-go shots and for spontaneous recording when opportunities present themselves.<br /><br />The Flip is small - a little smaller than an ice cream sandwich. It may be little, but there's tremendous convenience in being able to drop your camcorder in your shirt pocket or your purse and have it at the ready. This compact size holds everything you need to start recording - batteries, flash RAM and all. Without tapes or DVD media on which to record, there's little reason for this device to be any bigger.<br /><br />It is a solid little thing and feels durable. That doesn't mean it would do well if dropped or stepped on, but it likely will be ok if jostled a little.<br /><br />Recording is simple. No, I should be more clear - recording with the Flip is trivial. There is no real science to using it: turn it on, point and press record. Press the record button again to stop recording. Even technological novices, or people afraid of electronics will have no trouble using the Flip to record. Playing back is equally simple - once the recording is finished, press the Play button.<br /><br />There are + and - buttons, used for Zoom. The Flip doesn't have a particularly capable zoom, so shooting from a distance will not yield especially great results.<br /><br />I tested this camcorder in my basement on a bright, sunny day, and I wandered about recording and chattering to myself. When I played back what I had recorded, I made a pleasant discovery - it does some light balancing and deals with changes in light levels so that the video is still clear. The sound is also good, better than I expected. When I walked down a dark hallway and into an unlit room, it had tried very hard to accommodate for the lack of light but it was unable to completely overcome the darkness. As there is no light on the camcorder to come on when it is dark, this is understandable, but it did surprisingly well in spite of that.<br /><br />I attached the Flip to my computer to pull the video to my hard drive. FlipShare installed itself and started up, seeing the video I had made. It allowed me to pull it over and even gave me the option to delete it from the camera. Once finished, I was able to play the video through FlipShare. Instead, I decided to hunt it down and use a different application to play it.<br /><br />I found the file and tried to open it with Windows Media Player. I got audio, but not video. When I switched to QuickTime, my video came up and filled my screen. This is the point at which I made an unfortunate discovery. Every minute move I had made while recording was now plainly obvious, as there is no anti-jitter built into the device.<br /><br />The video, on a 1440x900 resolution screen, looked clear. It records at 1280x720, which is not that much smaller, so I was a little surprised. I would have expected a little pixelation, but this actually was not an issue.<br /><br />There are few settings that can be adjusted on the Flip - language, date, time and recording light.<br /><br />The Flip is a nice camcorder that provides tremendous convenience and fun. It is very easy to use and very compact. It is important to remember that it has some limitations which make it a less-than-ideal choice for more serious application, but if those limitations are not an issue for you then the Flip is a fun and affordable way to capture things on video.",positive,positive

B0051GN9NS,5.0,"To be honest, I got my IPAD about 2 months ago and purchased a bluetooth keyboard case (from Amazon of course). I was finding it to be a bit cumbersome to travel locally with, like going to the stores (although I admit it is nice to be able to type on a keyboard). Anyway, I was looking for an alternative case to be able to use as just a case (nothing to do with a keyboard). I saw this offered to me in Vine and figure I could give it an honest review. To start with, I didn't know if I would like the red plaid design of the cover. It is just gorgeous and I am so happy I got this. It looks smart (for either a man or a woman). The cover in general is padded and my IPAD2 is well protected. Inside there is a secure holders which snuggly fits my IPAD and on the alternate side on the cover is a side pocket for document storage and an elastic band which will keep any other items in place (i.e. a small calculator etc). I would see this as a great accessory for a business person who would like a little bit of storage with their case and it behaves almost like a small portfolio case. The back  corner of the cover has a perfectly fit hole which allows you to continue to use the camera feature while the IPAD 2 stays snug in the case. I honestly have nothing but good things to say about the Marco cover. It looks smart and protects my IPAD2, all while giving me some handy side features. To top it all off it has the Smart magnetic feature which puts the IPAD to sleep when closed and wakes it up when opened (saves battery life).

B00005O7CO,2.0,"Sanyo DS25390 is a simple, no- frills television that offers enough features to get by but is lacking in some of the basics that we now take for granted in television sets, making it a questionable choice of sets for many consumers. Starting with the remote control, this television is very limited and quite out of date. Besides the usual keys (the ten numbered buttons, power button, etc.), you get a set- up key, CC key (closed captioning), Enter, and a Previous Channel selector. The various settings for the television can be accessed from the remote using the menu button, and they include the usual options (changing brightness, color, etc.). There isn't much more to it than that and the control itself has an old- fashioned look to it.<br /><br />Picture quality on Sanyo DS25390 is okay, but nothing exceptional. The sharpness is the greatest weakness of this Sanyo television. Depending on your distance from the screen, the images seem a little fuzzy on the edges. At a good distance, this problem is minimized well enough that most people will not notice but it is definitely not as sharp as the picture on most newer models.<br /><br />Picture quality is most important, but one other important consideration when choosing any television is its features and friendliness to accessories. Sanyo DS25390 has limited abilities and limited features. Chief among these is the limits on input. There are only a few input and output jacks and, because of this, there is no way to directly hook up a DVD player or video camera. This fact alone would probably discourage most people from considering this television. You could probably connect a DVD player or other device by going through a VCR first, but how many among is still own a VCR? I realize this television set was considered acceptable during its day, but it is difficult to overlook things like this.<br /><br />One other problem I have with this television is the sound quality. There is only one small speaker, so the sound delivered is in mono. This certainly reduces the sound quality when watching certain movies or music video. The sound is acceptable for most television shows because the need for stereo quality isn't important. But it isn't very good for certain films and other programs that are greatly enhanced with stereo sound.<br /><br />Overall, Sanyo Model DS25390 is a difficult television set to evaluate. It seems adequate in some ways and it was probably considered a good television set when it was first introduced. But compared to modern televisions, I cannot imagine anyone buying this set. The fact that a DVD player cannot be directly hooked up to this television is reason enough to reject it. Add to that the picture quality and its lack of sharpness and you have a television set that is too flawed to recommend. It's inexpensive, yes. But you most certainly get what you pay for.",negative,negative
B0195Y0A42,5.0,Wow this is the easiest thing to install if your roter has wps switch just pair the extender and &#34;walllaha&#34; you have extended your wifi coverage and when it's pair with the router you just relocate it and plug it in where you think it's the dead zone and when the led turns gree that means you have very strong connection and also on the device wifi menu on either your tablet or any device that connects to phone it will display as whatever you named your router for example i have tplink so at the end it will display as tplink.ext. there it is it's very easy.to install.,positive,negative

B07XVFB67J,5.0,"I was really amazed at the sound! A tiny speaker the size of a soda can that creates a wonderful sound environment. I have it hooked to my Echo dot and the sound clarity is really good! And the bass coming out of the top is pretty precise. It's not the thundering bass but the correct one (to my ears). Takes up really a very small space.<br /><br />Set up was very easy. Pressed a button to pair it with Echo using Bluetooth. My phone and Echo both picked it up really quick. Can't really tell if it's going to work in long distance but I have no reason to doubt what the manufacturer is claiming.<br /><br />The only issue I had was figuring out how to use the volume buttons. I assume it's a quick press to lower or increase the volume but it's actually a long press. And then I am not sure how long to hold down the button to increase and decrease since there's no visual cue. But once I found the right volume it's OK. I can control the actual volume from the source as well.<br /><br />I got the black one so it sits very nicely behind a few Knick Knacks and not really visible. The sound is ""surround"" so it's not directional. I have not paired it up with a twin to test out the stereo effect. But that's not how I intend to use this speaker anyways.<br /><br />Very happy with this purchase. Kudos to the engineers for putting together such a nice speaker!",positive,positive

B00APPDX86,5.0,"After a bad experience with another flat amp antenna I purchased the leaf for just over $50 .<br />It picks up 19 stations in the ""low country"" around a lot of tall pine trees.(20 is the max number of stations in a 60 mile radius here with any antenna according to the TV manufacturer).<br /><br />You can paint the ant/ cables to match the walls. Comes with push pins for walls and Velcro for wall or window if you want them.Also has a plug into TV for the amp or you can plug into the wall like I did so it isn't hampered by the surge protector.<br /><br /> I get ABC, CBS,NBC,FOX,THIS,3 PBS stations, 3 Christian channels,a Spanish channel, WE,GET,MY,BOUNCE,YOU TOO, one music video channel and one other. The reception on all (but 2) is exceptionally strong with no blips in power even if you cannot put it in a window. I have mine hanging behind my curtain and most channels get 90-100% station strength almost constantly when 35%, even 30% will give you the station clear enough to watch a program with very few ""blips"" in reception.<br /><br />I am enjoying not adjusting the Rabbit ear antenna (when I watched certain channels) even though it worked *good* enough for the money.<br /><br />If you had another antenna before that only picked up 5-13 channels (for exp.) and you switch to a more powerful one like this, remember to unplug your TV a good minute before re- auto programming ( I forgot at first myself) as some TVs seem to ""remember"" how many it gets and stops at that number.<br /><br />No need for an ugly outside antenna with this one.<br /><br />When I use my hair dryer or turn on another ""power draw"", it doesnt get the interference the previous amplified antenna had, so probably uses less electricity, yet pulls in more stations.<br />I'm very happy with it. I get more channels than my basic cable had that I enjoy watching also.",positive,negative
B00LM07HKI,5.0,"I received this as a free review sample. First, this is for low draw devices like mice, keyboards, thumb drives and the such. It will NOT support an external drive that gets its power from your machine's USB port.<br /><br />For me this is perfect because it's USB 2.0 only (although it will also kick down to USB 1.1). I am using it on an old ThinkPad T61, which immediately recognized it as soon as I plugged it in. I did not test the Ethernet connection (which needs a separate driver on my XP machine), but the USB ports are problem free.<br /><br />As a test I tried this hub on my Note 4 phone using a [[ASIN:B00LM4PDUU LinkS Micro-USB 3.0 OTG Adapter]] and the USB ports worked like they did on my T61. Again, I did not test the Ethernet port, but did populate two USB ports with a keyboard and mouse, and both were immediately recognized by the phone.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a nice way to expand USB ports for low power draw devices. The Ethernet port is a bonus and especially if you need to direct connect to a router, but you may need to download a driver to get it working.",positive,negative
B01GE79L98,4.0,Great for taking pictures when your house / office is dark. I bought 2 desk spot lamps and it works even at night. Taking off 1 star for no instructions and no way to fold it back up to put into bag. I got creative with chip clips.

B01H6I3YGK,3.0,"I bought this so I could switch my audio between my computer that is hooked up to my tv and just play audio from the tv when I’m not using the computer. The transmitter has a small footprint which is nice and several different types of ports you can plug into. The thing I didn’t like was that it could not automatically switch between which audio device was transmitting. If I switched from my computer to something on my tv then I would have to manually change it. When I tried to make it so that my computer would automatically connect via Bluetooth the transmitter would continually say “connecting “ over and over again it was super annoying. I didn’t care for this one but I got avantree audikast and I love it, it does exactly what I want it to do. So this device is not bad, the audio commands from the device is pretty annoying but it is an okay device",positive,positive
B011M98OM8,4.0,"I received this as a free review sample. As advertised the protection is excellent. The construction is as well, and you actually can turn it inside out to change the color scheme.<br /><br />Here is the 'but': this case literally fits the Sound Blaster Roar 2 like a glove (and it is only for the Roar 2 model.) The stretching and pulling required is a bit onerous. I thought it would be a learning curve issue, but each time I use this bag it is as difficult as the last time. Difficult, but not impossible. On the other hand, had this been designed for an easier fit I am not sure the same level of protection would be there.<br /><br />Also note that this is strictly for transporting the Roar 2. Once it is inserted in this case you cannot access controls. I kind of like that because I do carry my Roar 2 around and appreciate the fact that this will keep it from getting dinged.<br /><br />One final thing: the top cover does not completely close. There is a gap and there is no zipper. That is why you can turn this inside out.<br /><br />Bottom line: this provides excellent protection and is well made. On the other hand, there are challenges as I noted above and you will need to weight those into a purchase decision. I do use mine a lot and have a love/hate relationship with it.",positive,positive
B007D7P4LS,2.0,"The good and the bad.<br /><br />The good is that these work.  I plugged them in and walla!, sound.<br /><br />The bad is the pause button is pretty sporadic.  I use these kind of headphones with my ipod to listen to audio books.  The pause button is absolutely essential (honestly, having a pause button saves the battery on your ipod, so I guess it's important that way too).  But it just didn't work every time, sometimes, even with lifting it up and very deliberately pressing the button one time, it would stick and whatever you are listening to would advance.  This isn't super bad if you are listening to music, you just might cut short you favorite jam.  But if you are listening to an audio book it will advance to the next chapter of a book, before you have finished listening to it.<br /><br />This has caused me supreme annoyance, trying to go back and find my spot in an audiobook means you will end up having to listen to something twice because it it is pretty impossible to find where you left off.<br /><br />So, these were super duper cheap, I use them on my computer now because I don't have to worry about the pause button, I have a mouse and keyboard for that.<br /><br />Guess you get what you pay for.",negative,negative

B08J49LLHR,4.0,"The Mcoplus VM-M03 Metal Shotgun Video Microphone is the next step in my attempt to address sound quality issues in my videos.

B00MHPWZI6,5.0,"I have been shooting a Canon 50D DSLR for several years, mostly outside or with stage lighting. Occasionally, I also have been using a small camera-mounted flash, but it is weak and very limited.  To improve my flash photography, I decided to try the Mago Speedlight by Pixel. This is an excellent, mid-priced flash with loads of features.<br /><br />The Mago Speedlight comes with a nice soft case and a fold-out manual which guides you through the setup of the flash and includes screenshots of the back LCD. It also includes a small stand which is great for use in slave mode, and a clip-on flash defuser. The flash uses 4 AA batteries or an external power supply (not provided). It is even upgradable via a USB port hidden in the battery compartment (not tested).<br /><br />The controls are easy to use after some experimenting. The manual really helps as there are so many features. The buttons are solid and the display is easy to read, with an optional green backlight.<br /><br />The flash head can be tilted up and down, or rotated left or right. It also includes a built-in defuser and a white card reflector. These are very useful if you are not bouncing the flash off of a ceiling or reflector.<br /><br />One interesting feature is an LED model light that can be turned on/off easily via a dedicated button. This light is quite bright and very useful for setting up your shots.<br /><br />I tested the flash on a Canon 50D with 20mm and 50mm lenses and somewhat cooperative subjects (my kids). After learning the controls, I took several excellent pictures.<br /><br />The flash supports E-TTL mode, manual mode, and multi-flash mode. I tested all three.<br /><br />To test the multi-flash mode, I set the flash to 5 bursts at 500 HZ and took a picture of fan blades, resulting in a very interesting effect.<br /><br />As a final test, I put the flash in slave move (S1) and put my old flash on the camera.  This flash worked great as a slave flash and I took some interesting pictures using both flashes.  I also used S1 mode to slave the this flash to the camera's on-board flash.  Note, I did not test the wireless flash mode (a smart slave mode) as I do not have another flash that supports that feature.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost, I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",positive,positive

B073BVWRSP,4.0,"I use this to play music while I'm riding my bike to work everyday so I have it turned up full blast the whole way.  It takes full volume without distortion but I wish it could pump out a bit more bass (has a slight rattle when the speakers bottom out).<br /><br />Still, for the price and against competing portable speakers it gets LOUD and pairs seamlessly with my phone.  I get a week's worth of riding out of a charge, so that's roughly 12 hours of full volume playing without dying on me.  Pretty good.  I like this speaker, it sounds good, it plays loud and since I use it 12 hours a week I generally get a year or two out of it before it breaks.

B07XJZMBVT,4.0,"Two members of the family just told me that they had broken their headphones with this product came up to get.  I decided it was worth a try, despite some previous experiences not being too great with cheaper headphones.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These headphones make some claims.  They come in a great box who for Carlos fans will be a thrill.  It is well decorated and presentation is fabulous.  That means they would be a nice gift in that respect.<br /><br />LEATHER?<br />The case says that these are leather padded ear cups and underneath headband.  I am still not sure about this.  Perhaps it is that bonded leather that is made from leather residue chopped up and blended with binders to remake it into sheets which are printed with leather look imprinting.  Technically that can be called leather, but it really is not as much leather as I would like.<br /><br />EAR CUPS AND HEADBAND<br />Having said that, these white headphones are comfortable.  I can wear them longer than some others that I have had which are a bit rough after only an hour.  These can be worn for several hours without a problem.<br /><br />CORD<br />This comes with a cord which is only 38 inches long.  That is a bit short for me.  I find it is annoying and not quite as long as I would prefer.<br /><br />SOUND<br />The sound of these is surprisingly great.  The bass is really good, and the mids and highs are definitely clear and not muddy.<br /><br />CONTROLS<br />The controls on the white pair are awful in that they are nearly impossible to read.  The buttons are white and the markings are just very thin raised white on the buttons.  It should really be colored with marker- which I took care of.  Using a very fine permanent marker I colored just the raised areas.  The up/down and play pause buttons are separated by the noise cancellation button which is good.<br /><br />ADJUSTABILITY<br />These are very adjustable.  They go longer, tilt in and out and rotate from side to side.<br /><br />COMPACT?<br />These do fold flat and compact if you need to travel with them or store them in a smaller place.<br /><br />SOUND CANCELLATION<br />THAT is where we part ways with these headphones.  The noise cancellation is awful.  It barely works.  When it is turned on, the sound gets really compromised too.  It becomes almost muffled in a way.<br /><br />OTHER FEATURES<br />The ability to know how much power is left on the headphones while using the phone is nice, but it does not help if you are not using it with a phone and some other bluetooth device.  Calling, people hear just fine and we can hear them too (several of us tried this feature with our phones)<br /><br />THE  BOTTOM LINE<br />For the price, these headphones are a step up from what I usually get when I try them.  The sound is very good and well balanced, the folding up for storage is great, and the comfort is also on the upper level.  The only disappointments are noise cancellation, short cord for corded listening, and the hard to read buttons.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  If the noise cancellation worked better, these would be over the top amazing.  As they are, they are still pretty great.  I love the white color- it stands out from the rest, despite getting dirty faster.  They are a great gift to yourself or someone else and are some of the nicer headphones I have used.",positive,positive
B004SBBD1C,4.0,"I used this daily, and it lasted for about 9 months worked great.  It is now sometimes not making the sound come out both speakers ""in stereo"".

B09M8991B5,5.0,"After using surge protection for audio, video and computer equipment for more than 30 years I can definitely say not all of these products are created equally.<br /><br />While surge protectors will often boast of great protection, more often than not they are more multi outlet plugs rather than actual protection.<br /><br />I have thoroughly tested this wall surge protector and it has passed all of my testing.  This will definitely protect your important investments.<br /><br />The only thing I wish was different was the outlets should be spaced a bit further apart to allow for larger power blocks, or better yet that the outlets rotated as so often plugs are of a size where they extend over another outlet.  The 3 USB-A ports are definitely a nice addition as this helps avoid having to use plugs for USB powered devices.  I like having the indicator lights readily letting me know that the device is working properly.<br /><br />This is an outstanding surge protector that has proven itself through extensive use and testing.<br /><br />This is definitely a surge protector I recommend.",positive,positive

B07S1T38TC,4.0,"Bottom Line - The speaker itself is excellent but Bluetooth can be an irritating technology.<br /><br />The speaker is lightweight and even has an attached carrying strap. Unlike a lot of lightweight products though, it doesn't feel flimsy or fragile at all. Instead it has a nice, solid, durable feel to it. While I am not an audiophile, the speaker has a deep, rich sound that I really like. It does well with audiobooks, music, and videos.<br /><br />The problems seem to be with Bluetooth.  One major issue is that the sound stutters while using Bluetooth. It's very noticeable when playing music and very irritating when listening to audiobooks. That's happened with every Bluetooth speaker I've ever tried. A google search indicates that it's a common problem related to the amount of information the computer is trying to pump out to the speaker. There's a checklist of possible issues to go through to try to fix the problem but the stuttering seems all too common with this technology.<br /><br />Another issue involves changing modes on a Bluetooth speaker. To sidestep the stuttering I plugged this speaker into my computer with a standard jack. It worked fine and the sound was good. When I unplugged it to bring the speaker into another room with me, I had to redo my audio settings. When I plugged it back in with the jack, an audiobook played just fine but there was no sound while playing videos. Again, I had to go into the audio settings and fiddle with them to be able to watch a movie. I've had similar issues with other Bluetooth speakers.<br /><br />If you are a techie you may be able to resolve such things quickly and easily. The less tech adept you are, the more hassle they will be though. Myself, I'm just going to leave the speaker connected to my pc via a good old fashioned jack because I like its sound. Bluetooth? Bah, I haven't got time to bother with it.",positive,negative
B076DD5JNS,5.0,"Akaso Brave 4 (Updated) Review<br /><br />Note: WiFi apps tested using a Google LG Nexus 5x without a sim card, which is a spare phone I use to control my GoPro Hero4. I haven't tested it with my Galaxy S9, because I don't plan to use them together. You may have different results with a different phone, and there may be a better app than the recommended one. LD Cam, for instance, almost works better, but not quite.<br /><br />Note2: Manufacturer claims ""Since 4K resolution is too big, APP does not support."" Well, the GoPro app does. I think it's the software library used in many of the other apps that limit the size to 1080p. USB transfers work extremely well. It identifies as a USB drive on the PC and other devices.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Inexpensive compared to GoPro (less than a used Hero 4 Black)<br />-4K/24fps is higher frame rate than GoPro Hero 4<br />-Simple to use (other than the WiFi app)<br />-Plenty of useful settings and features<br />-Can be used with a PC as a webcam<br />-Windows 10 recognizes it and loads a driver for it<br />-Connects via USB-OTG to Galaxy S9 flawlessly for transferring files<br />-Doesn't overheat like both my GoPro Hero 4 and Hero 7 Black.<br />-Very lightweight.<br />-Works great when set up as a dash cam.<br />-Doesn't overheat and shut down like a GoPro.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Recommended WiFi apps don't support 4K (yet?)<br />-Recommended WiFi apps require mobile data be turned off (even without a sim card)<br />-Recommended WiFi apps don't stay connected with my Nexus 5x<br />-WiFi apps reset camera settings to arbitrary values<br />-WiFi has to be turned off and back on and app restarted if it disconnects<br />-Battery cover could be easier to remove<br />-Not a rugged camera (though not that heat sensitive)<br />-Klemme 1, an open tripod mount, doesn't hold the camera firmly so wouldn't work as an action mount (used a heat gun to tighten it up and it's tolerable now.<br /><br />Other:<br />Though this looks like a GoPro Hero 4, and is very similar in size and layout, it's only similar. They're different enough to prevent using a Hero 4 case. Not much. Just a little. But enough. That's unfortunate, because the Suptig case I have works with an external battery that allows me to record for several hours (5+) with the Hero 4. I was hoping this would work with that case, but it won't. That's what happens when I have unreasonable expectations.<br /><br />It abruptly adjusts to changing light conditions but lags slightly behind during rapidly changing conditions, particularly when using time-lapse, so that going from the darkness under a bridge to bright sunlight while driving often results in a total whiteout. I haven't notice the same effect with the GoPro Hero 4, and I suspect that it ramps a bit more slowly from darkness to light to avoid this effect.<br /><br />If the recommended WiFi app, or the alternative worked better, I'd give it one more star (gave it that one more star after using it as a dash cam). Even with all the cons relating to WiFi, I actually like the camera, and think it's worth the ~$80 I paid for it.",positive,negative
B00FDK4GXY,5.0,"I received this as a review sample and tested the claimed specifications on a few platforms. The following are my observations that, with  Debbie Lee Wesselmann's excellent review, should give you a complete picture of this hub.<br /><br />First, word about using this hub for charging devices.  The specs on this product page at the time of this review claim that this hub will NOT charge devices. Actually, it charged my two phones and another device while I was doing other tasks. Perhaps the specs mean it is not intended to be a standalone charger. The only thing that I do NOT like is the wall wart type power supply that is approximately 3x2x2 inches. It can (and does) block adjacent plugs in my surge protector. However, I can live that that considering the functionality I get from this hub.<br /><br />My favorite feature and the reason I awarded this hub five stars is the integrated electrical safeguards that protect against over voltage, over current, leakage and short circuits. This may not be a big deal for cheap peripherals like mice, but for an expensive hard drive or my Galaxy Note 3 it's a welcome feature.<br /><br />If you have a computer and peripherals that are USB 3.0 compliant this hub will boost your transfer speeds significantly. For example, my new Samsung Note 3 will transfer at the 5gbps speed, but frankly I do most of my data transfers over WiFi. However, if you wanted to attach an external 3.0 hard drive to your laptop this hum will allow it to operate to it's full potential - which is lightning fast.<br /><br />Set-up is easy. You literally connect the included power supply, plug it into your system's USB port and switch it on. All of platforms with which I tested it immediately recognized the hub and the things I plugged into it (which included a flash drive, mouse, two snart phones (Galaxy Note II and Note 3), and a speaker that is powered by USB.<br /><br />This hub works with Windows 98 (I have an old Sony running it and this hub plugged in and worked with it), and above. I know it works with Win XP, Vista and 7 because I also tested the hub on those platforms. I do not have access to a Windows 8 system so am taking the manufacturer's word that it works on that too. If your experience is different please leave a comment.<br /><br />One final feature that makes this a five star hub in my opinion is the fact that this will simultaneously support maximum data transfer of up to four high speed devices (three of which can be USB 3.0) plugged into it. Of course the host system needs to be USB 3.0 too, but the hub will sling data as fast as the host can accept it. Not all hubs will operate in this mode, and I suspect that the external power supply has something to do with that level of performance.",positive,negative
B08F4TY5PG,5.0,"My son participates in an online meeting weekly, and he needed a new webcam to replace the one he was using. The old one worked but was not of good quality. Based on the asking price for this webcam I was not especially hopeful. That said, it has proven to be better than either of us expected.<br /><br />It's easy to set up - plug it in and let the OS configure it. It's easy enough to use, too, by selecting the camera desired if there's more than one.<br /><br />We have seen no issues with clarity or audio/video quality, which have both been solid and reliable. In his meeting, others have commented that his feed seems to be the clearest and most glitch-free.<br /><br />At least one other reviewer noticed issues with lag and skipping. This has not been an issue for us and so far this little camera has performed well without incident.<br /><br />The model we received did not have the mini tripod. However, it has a standard mount for a tripod and those little tripods are easy enough to find. If you already have a tripod of any size, this webcam will mount without issue.<br /><br />Could it be better? Sure. But, improvement would drive up the cost, and the quality is good as it is. For the asking price, this is a great little webcam.",positive,positive
B09NMX96FD,1.0,"EDIT 2/12/23. These owners are JERKS! Before sending this back for a refund I had canceled my subscription so when the two month free trial ran out we wouldn’t be charged a fee. Well now that the trial is over, we’re being charged! I’m not sure how it’s possible when the it was canceled and subscription has expired. I have proof of screen shots and from the settings in my phone. Since it was canceled I can’t log into the account because it no longer exists!! This makes no sense at all!! Now we have to go to the bank and show them proof to get out money back and cancel the card they have on file. What they’re doing is ILLEGAL! And we will be reporting them to BBB and filing a complaint with Amazon. This is such BS! It’s sad we have to worry about scammers on Amazon. Do not trust this business. I should’ve googled this company before buying from them. When I researched them, this exact problem came up without actually searching the situation. Please trust me when I tell you there’s so many red flags and not to buy from them.<br />  *************************************************<br /><br />Edit-12/10/22<br />We decided to return everything. We didn’t bother trying out the camera we got as a replacement? Just the solar panel we swapped to see if it was that or camera. It was definitely the camera . The app was very confusing. And I’m someone who is tech savvy and have had several diff brands and types of cameras for outside and inside our homes. Once I figured out how to use it, it constantly crashed and camera malfunctioned. It always went off line. The wifi connection was perfect and was never an issue. Just way too many issues in such a short time period. We bought the SD card and subscriptions. It would pick up stuff that wasn’t even there. It say a car was detected when there was clearly no car. The settings were set so it shouldn’t had picked up anything 2-3 streets over. So it wasn’t because of how it was set. At first it would pick up when someone pulled into our driveway then suddenly stopped. Nothing was changed on the app or the camera had not been adjusted.<br />One feature that we absolutely hated was that we could not go back through the footage.<br />IT ONLY RECORDS WHEN THERE IS MOVEMENT. so if you want to go back to look at footage throughout the day, this is not for you! Go with something else.<br />Needless to say this just didn’t work out for us as planned. We’ve been buying NETVUE for inside the house and have been happy with them. We should’ve just got that brand from the start but I like to try new brands and features time to time. So anyways we bought an outside camera from that company and will put it up this weekend.<br />One thing we liked about this camera was that it’s very light and was easy to set up and position. Some cameras are heavy but this one wasn’t. Too bad it didn’t stand up to our expectations and positive reviews.<br />***************************************************<br />EDIT-11/26/22<br />Shortly after my review our camera stopped charging and the battery continues to stay at zero %. This is why I don’t like writing reviews too early. Seems when I do, there’s an issue soon after when it comes to certain things like electronics. Anyways we’re not 100% sure it’s the solar panel. I contacted Amazon to exchange the solar panel and camera to figure out which one is the issue. We will first start with the panel and go from there. I’ll come back again to update my review.<br /><br />  *********************************************<br /><br />We bought this solar panel for our new “Wyze Cam Outdoor Starter Bundle v2 (Includes Base Station and 1 Cam), 1080p HD Indoor/Outdoor Wireless Smart Home Camera with Color Night Vision, 2-Way Audio, Works with Alexa & Google - 1 Camera Kit”<br />I’m going to talk a little bit about the camera as well as the solar panel since they go hand in hand. We’ve only had the solar panel and camera up just a little over two weeks( Halloween 2022) it’s now November 14th 2022. So far so good. It keeps our camera charged at 100% at all times. Haven’t had to take camera down to charge it which is the point of the solar panel. The solar panel is in an area where there’s nothing blocking it from the sun. No trees or anything are in the way. We slanted it hoping if snow or ice get into in during winter months that they’ll slide right off and not build up. Time will tell as we’re getting into winter here in Western Massachusetts. It was Very easy to install and connect. The cord to the solar panel is very long, at least 2-3 feet I’d say. We didn’t need the extra cord so we wrapped it up and used a zip tie to secure it and stuck it in the gutter. But I’m glad they give the option as you never know how far away they’ll need to be from each other. And we won’t have to worry about length or anything if we need to move it elsewhere in the future.<br />Keep in mind you’ll need to buy a mount if you plan on putting it on your gutters. There are  mounting kits on Amazon that’s is a 2 in 1. Meaning it holds the camera and solar panel. Originally that’s what we bought. Then decided to relocate the camera because we couldn’t adjust the camera in a way to get a full view due to the design of the mount, we were limited to aiming it upward.this may not be a factor for all, it depends on where you want to see. We also decided it be better to put the camera underneath the roof where the vents are to prevent ice dams (please see picture I provided) so it’s not directly in the sun, rain and snow. I would think that would prolong the life of the camera and preventing the lense from getting blocked so we can see everything that’s going on. Anyways So we bolted the camera to to that. Keep in mind that even though the camera is installed like that, someone could easily grab it down since it’s held together with magnets. Just Make sure it’s high enough. You’d need a ladder where we have it.<br />I read some reviews that stated the plug wasn’t secured into the camera from the solar panel. We did not have any issues with it staying in. Maybe the company fixed the issue and redesigned it? Or maybe they received a defected item?<br />Since this is an early review, I’ll come back after a few months to update if my opinion changes in any way. I hope this was helpful.  I tried to include information that I was looking for before buying this camera and solar panel.",negative,negative
B07G2G18YH,5.0,"My husband enjoys listening to podcasts when mowing the lawn. He was very impressed with the noise canceling capabilities of these headphones. It was then that he realized that his previous headphones didn't have that feature. He said he they blocked out nearly all the sounds of the lawn mower. It also blocked out my voice when I called to him when usually he can hear me after a moment or so. These are light weight and comfortable to wear. It was simple to pair with his phone. He has had other Bluetooth headphones before, but these have been his favorite pair. The sound quality is good - though he tends to listen to podcasts rather than music with headphones.",positive,positive
B07GMJP6KT,3.0,"Okay, so this tracker had me intrigued because it can be taken out and used as an earbud. I mean, that's pretty cool, cause you can be at the gym and it'd still be recording all the steps and stuff but also use it to listen to music and stuff. Well, it wasn't as cool as I thought and while the sound is okay, it isn't as good as the normal earbuds I use when I am out at the gym. I also don't feel it really is able to keep up when it's in my ear and I am doing stuff compared to when it's on my wrist and I am doing something. I don't know, I feel like my wrist tracker is hands-down better compared to this tracker. As for receiving phone calls, it works pretty well and it's cool to just pop it out and talk but I can do all that with my normal earbuds too and as I said before, they sound a whole lot better. So, yeah, these are all right but I doubt I will use it anymore just to be honest.",positive,negative

They're fans of the Transformers, and these look like they're designed after Optimus Prime. Of course they fought over them at first (I was only offered one set), so I might have to get another one.<br /><br />So far they've held up to kid wear and tear, which is considerable. I thought the sound was pretty good for them, but the big thing is that the kids are just willing to wear them.

The reason for three stars instead of four or five is one of the sliders that close off the plug area just fell off  a week after it was delivered and I couldn't for the life of me get it back on.

B08LPTJ5QX,4.0,"These are nice compact shelf speakers. They are budget priced so the sound is budget, too. Bought them for a record player.

B09V2YMXN5,5.0,"This is useful for so many things. If you want a big easy to use knob for your gaming setup or live audio production rig, this is a really great way to avoid having to hunt for buttons or click volume controls with your mouse. I like that the LED glows under the knob, but I sort of wish it stayed on all the time so I could find it quickly in the dark (it lights up during use, but then seems to turn off the light after a few seconds of non use).<br />Personally, I wanted to use this to add a volume knob to my aftermarket car radio. For some reason, new head units all rely on buttons and touch screens, but I want a good old fashioned volume knob. Thankfully this is compatible pretty universally as a USB input device (no drivers, so even Android can recognize it!) so I can pop off the knob and drill a hole in my double din adapter to mount the knob behind my dash. Plug it in, and it changes the volume as needed. Awesome! It isn't designed to work this way, you're supposed to just connect it to a desktop I think, but the fact that it worked the way I wanted means this makes it also a great modder/hacker/tinkerer's tool.",positive,positive
B06XHGS32J,5.0,I bought this for my husband who likes to watch tv at a very high volume and is a channel flipper. Now I can read and he can watch tv and we are both happy. He really loves this adapter that hooks right up with his wireless headphones.,positive,positive
B08M1VJHVD,4.0,"I use this to stream audio to my TWS headphones so I can listen to music, videos, and audio books while working out or doing  projects around the house. I've been using it for about a month now, and I'm pretty satisfied with it.<br /><br />It worked on plug-in with Manjaro KDE, and integrated with the OS without any additional configuration. It reliably auto-connects and the system even routes audio to it while it is connected, and then restores it to my main headphones when it is not.<br /><br />Audio quality is decent, about what you would expect from something like this. Not as good as a direct connection obviously, but for most non-critical listening this is perfectly sufficient. Just make sure your headphones support the higher bitrate codecs - I knew mine didn't, but double check to be sure. I have some Bose Soundsport Free headphones which are vented, which is great because I can hear what's going on around the house, but they don't support any advanced codec at all. So I end up with about a 500ms delay on the audio. That's fine for me - if I'm at my desk, I'm using my main headphones anyway, but just be aware.<br /><br />Range is tricky. With the Soundsports, it's pretty bad, maybe twenty feet in open air, ten feet if there's any obstruction. I have some Sony WF-1000XM4 TWS earbuds and they do better, but only by about 50%. If you are going more than 15ft from the source, you may have issues. However, my system is close to a wireless router and a UPS, so that may be interfering in my case.<br /><br />Broadly, for this price, I'd recommend this. Sure you can look for higher quality transmitters that go for $50-$100, but until you pull the trigger on that, this should serve your purposes fine.",positive,positive
B001OC6DCW,5.0,"This is an excellent HDMI cable, at a very good price.<br /><br />Although certain vendors will urge you to spend large amounts on audio/video cables, all reliable and independent experts will tell you that the expensive cables don't give you anything extra (other than satisfaction of having spent more than your neighbor, perhaps).  You should certainly get good quality cables -- but paying more than around $10 for a 6/8 foot HDMI cable is definitely not necessary!<br /><br />This one might be just a wee bit better than other cables in this price range.  I replaced the cable I had been using with this one (using Sony BluRay player with Sony LCD HDTV), and found that although the difference was slight, the colors were just a bit richer and the picture perhaps very slightly sharper.  I wouldn't have paid more for that difference, but it's certainly pleasing to get it without having to pay more.<br /><br />I've used other products with this brand, and have generally been quite satisfied.",positive,positive

Maybe if i had bought a $200 one i would have gotten perfect results, but i didn't want to spend that amount. Also i've never used $200 headphones on a plane so im not able to compare how well this stacks up to that. but i can say that it did reduce the noise significantly and i was able to play soft music from the plane's selection, and get some sleep (as much as you can on economy class).",positive,negative
B0791TX5P5,4.0,I got the newest 4K streaming stick with alexa voice control remote. As of yet i haven't purchased a 4K T.V. but the firestick works on any high def T.V. with a hdmi port. There are lots of free movie and T.V. apps so you can cut the cord and save lots of $$ doing away with cable. You will just have to simply connect a OTA antenna to the back of your TV to receive your local channels. The remote is ok but not great. It does sync easily with your T.V.s CEC control and lets you use the remote for T.V. power on and off. Volume control and alexa voice command. But personally i found it just as quick and easy to manually navigate the apps you want to watch rather than using the button on the remote to ask for a certain app. More times than not the voice control will get what your asking it wrong. But the volume control and power control on the remote is a very good plus over the basic remote. The battery compartment for remote is a little tricky to get opened at first but if you just apply a slight pressure at the same time as sliding the compartment down jt will slide right open. And getting to the streaming quality it will depend on which app you are using. Surprising to me is that the Amazon Prime Video app uses a lot more wifi data than most of the other apps making the shows and movies buffer quite a bit sometimes. I am curious why Amazon Prime uses so much more data vs Netflix or Hulu for example but it surely does. And if you have a Roku device and are used to the Rokus functions it will take a bit of getting used to how the Firestick apps are downloaded and stored compared to the Roku. But they both have equally good and bad comparisons when it comes to their individual functions. Both have excellent picture and sound. What i would really like is for Amazon's firestick to have a remote control app for your android or ios phone. Roku does have the free remote app to download and works great navigating and also has alexa voice control and tou can plug earphones into your phone for private listening. And also remember when buying a firestick to check the gift box if it is going to be used by someone else in their home. If you check the connect to my account box instead all of your information on your other firesticks will be on the new one and also the Amazon buying app with your personal information. So be vigilante and at least have a PIN set up on your Amazon account so no non approved purchases can be made.,positive,negative

B08K8KTMJD,5.0,"This is great for mounting smart speakers or cameras to a wall. It is actually pretty ingenious the way it is designed to wrap the cable behind the base and then allow it down the back. I originally got mine to try mounting an Xbox Kinect sensor to the wall, but after seeing the heavy duty plastic I think I'm changing my mind and putting this in my bathroom to hold an electric toothbrush or shaver base and avoid unsightly cable mess.

B00DIFIM36,3.0,"I own two rabbit ear antennas:<br />- GE Model TV94713 VHF/UHF/FM<br />- RCA ANT111 Television - Radio - Indoor - FM - VHF - UHF<br /><br />I had replaced my GE Model on one 19"" Vizio HDTV with a Mohu Leaf Ultimate Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna which turned out to be a superb upgrade. Therefore, when this antenna came up for review, I decided to replace my RCA set-top on my other 19"" Vizio HDTV for this non-amplified Amazon Basics HDTV antenna.<br /><br />I live in northwestern NJ around 30 miles from NYC. In this area, my RCA gave me around 45 channels but in order to get those channels, I had to constantly adjust the antenna to bring in some stations.  After running the automatic channel scan, this Amazon Basics Antenna gives me 44 channels. In fact, a few of the channels I now receive appear to be different than the ones I received before because I do not recognize the call letters.<br /><br />The PROS are:<br /><br />- Installation was so simple. I attached the coax cable on the antenna to the antenna port on the back of my HDTV. Since the coax cable is very long, I was able to run the cable up the wall and across a shelf and then let it hang on the other side.<br /><br />- I no longer have to adjust the antenna to bring in the channels.<br /><br />- The antenna is like a flat piece of cardboard which I can tape up if I want to. Two double-side 3M Command Brand Strips are provided for this purpose.  Personally I would not use this because if I want to adjust the reception, I'd have to remove the antenna from its permanent location.<br /><br />- The instructions are easy to understand.<br /><br />The CONS are:<br /><br />- The user pamphlet says to run a channel scan every month after the initial scan; however, the quick start guide says to run a scan every time you re-position the antenna after the initial scan.  Let's just say, I won't be doing this unless I have problems with receiving a particular channel.<br /><br />- The one big negative for me is that the picture quality is not as vibrant as with the RCA rabbit-ear antenna I used previously.  I do realize this is not an amplified antenna, but I did expect the picture quality to be equivalent to the RCA rabbit-ear I replaced and it is not. The colors appear to be washed out for most channels and the reception is closer on those channels to a ""dot pixel"" image rather than a vibrant image. For this reason, I consider this antenna to be just okay. However, I will continue to use this over my RCA because I don't have to adjust this antenna to get all the channels I sometimes view.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the current low price of $20.24 makes this a respectable choice if money is an issue. However, if a vibrant picture quality is most important, I would recommend looking into a Mohu Leaf Ultimate Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna (or equivalent) even though the cost is a little over three times the price.<br /><br />Also, it seems antennas for some are hit or miss depending on the area one lives in. The Amazon Basics user pamphlet recommends you check for a list of channels available in your area.  I put the URL in the comments section for those who are interested.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE Update 11/26/13 - This review is for the Amazon Basics Ultra Thin Indoor HDTV Antenna and not the High Performance or Extreme Performance Amplified Antennas.  Based on a comment someone made to this review, I discovered that Amazon is posting a review for any one of these antennas as a review for each of the invidiual ones.  Those other antennas may be better than the one I reviewed.  Please make sure the review you are reading applies to the antenna you are considering for purchase and if you are unsure, you might ask the reviewer to clarify that for you.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/27/13 - Another commenter pointed out that Amazon lists the item reviewed below my name in the review. I checked this out and that is correct. So another way to tell what item is being reviewed is to look at the tags below my name.",positive,negative
B010UU5M8E,4.0,"Summary:  Overall this is an excellent bluetooth headset for music and calls, with excellent sound.  It's reasonably comfortable to wear, but I find the weighted behind-the-neck loose cord troublesome and leading to ear discomfort after some time.<br /><br />Some specifics:<br />(1) Charges using a now-standard micro-usb port, makes it easy. Charges pretty quickly for hours of use.<br />(2) The sound is excellent for all kinds of music, including classical and rock.  I've been using it to listen to music from my phone, and have really enjoyed the clear, undistorted and well-balanced sound.  Definitely the best headset I've owned, except perhaps for my old pair of corded Sennheiser headphones.<br />(3) I found that the earbuds and retainers that came attached weren't quite right for me, but they thoughtfully include 3 sets of each.  After a little trial and error, I was able to find the combination that worked well for me.<br />(4) I find that the control near the right ear are a bit harder to use than I like: I sometimes find myself taking the right earbud off to do something.  They could have been positioned a bit further down, perhaps.<br />(5) There is a cylindrical weight in the middle of the cord, that I gather is supposed to go behind the neck.  Except it's really annoying, keeps falling to one side or the other, pulling at one of the earbuds.  When sitting I found it better to let it hang in front of me.  This is the kind of design you get when you have a &#34;great idea&#34; and fail to test it thoroughly with a number of users.<br /><br />So, while I do like these earbuds, I recommend them only with some reservations about the comfort and the fit.",positive,negative
B0BHSXDJ13,5.0,"This was my first projector, so I wasn't really sure what to expect in terms of quality. I was very impressed with this. The picture is bright, crisp, and it's really easy to set up. The only thing I wish it had was 4K, but I don’t think that is very common for projectors yet.<br /><br />For everyday use, this thing is great. It comes with a travel case that fits the projector + accessories (remote, cables, etc.) I hadn't used an projectors for YEARS, so to say I was blown away with the crispness and quality of the picture is an understatement. I love watching movies on this and I was pleased to see that it doesn't have to be PITCH black to use (darker is better, obviously, but the picture is still good with some light in the room).<br /><br />Another review talked about the noise the projector makes, which I didn't notice.

B00FF322AS,5.0,"Spent a lot of time looking for alternatives to the leather origami cases, which were just too expensive and had questionable functionality. So glad I found this this leather rooCase, which I have had long enough to be convinced it was the right choice, the best case out there in my view.<br /><br />The quality is superb and the price is very fair: real leather of good quality for only $38.<br /><br />A snap connects the inner leather sleeve / glove to the folding zipper case, which acts as a base and back so you can view the Kindle in portrait or landscape on almost any surface including an uneven bed -- even when your leaning nearby on the mattress makes the case slope slightly forward.<br /><br />There's plenty of air space around the sleeve along with openings for charging, on-off, volume control, and the speakers. Because of the good airflow, it runs 2-3 degrees centigrade cooler than when flat on a surface. My Kindle was getting too hot laying on my bed and had occasional freeze problems because of the heat. No more!!<br /><br />The case itself is made of high quality leather and has two zippers so you can zip from either side.

B07JYMFFVR,5.0,"I have worked with a lot of active noise canceling (ANC) headphones, from a large variety of manufacturers. Every set I have owned, from the top-of-the-line to the weakest and cheapest, has had its strengths and weaknesses. Until recently, Bose was the one to beat when it specifically came to the ANC function, though many others have a better sound profile. My favorite ANC phones are a set of Sony in-ear buds that rival Bose in ANC and trounce them in sound quality. When I found out that Microsoft had made an ANC headphone as well I did not have the highest of expectations – I expected mediocrity with the ANC and a reasonably good sound profile. I was dead wrong in both presuppositions – these are incredible headphones and are worth every penny of the asking price. They’re not absolutely perfect, but they’re better than one could reasonably expect.<br /><br />I’ll start by saying that I am sorry in advance for the lengthy review. I have a lot to say on these, and I would much rather give far too much information than not enough. The present asking price as I write this is $349 and that’s a lot of money to drop, so more information is better.<br /><br />Right out of the box these are relatively nondescript and don’t jump out as either flashy or gaudy. The controls that are visible and obvious are limited – a power button and a mute button, as well as the USB Type C power jack and a 3.5mm audio input jack. There are more controls, though, and it takes a quick glance at the documentation to get a feel for what’s there. There are two dials, one on each can, for controlling the level of ANC and for controlling the volume, L and R respectively. The flat portion of the cans facing outward are multi-function touch controls that allow you to play/pause, skip forward and backward, handle calls and also interact with your digital assistant. I will come back to that last point a little farther down.<br /><br />I powered these on and they immediately announced that they were ready to pair. I paired them to my iPhone and they connected and were usable quickly, faster than most Bluetooth devices I have used. I put them on, tapped once on the right ear and Pandora immediately started up. That was easy!<br /><br />The sound quality is very good though I will stop short of calling it audiophile level. The bass is good and not overdriven. I don’t care for deep, pounding bass and that is a problem with a lot of ANC phones I have used (Dre Beats being among the most aggressive in that regard). It softens as the volume level is dropped and that is very normal. The midrange is actually quite good with the proper amount of depth, so music sounds full and warm and not like it’s being piped through a tunnel. The highs are bright and clear though not piercing. Overall, these are among the most balanced ANC headphones when it comes to the sound profile. I cranked the volume and they don’t distort.<br /><br />The ability to adjust the ANC is not new; however, the way these headphones do it is very innovative and unlike anything else I have seen. The dial that controls it gradually lessens the amount of ANC that is applied when listening, in small but perceivable steps, until the ANC is turned off. With the central air on in the house, I gradually went from no ANC to maximum and it very gradually wiped out all of that sound. When at the maximum level the ANC is almost as aggressive as Bose, with a lot less of the the weird pressure sensation on the ears.<br /><br />A unique feature of these phones is integration with Cortana. When paired to a device running Cortana, simply saying “Hey, Cortana” gets its attention and you can interact with the same types of commands you use on the command line or the search window. It does require that Cortana be properly configured. I have Cortana installed on my iPhone (yes, you can do that and it works well), and the integration with the headphones when connected is good. I had a Windows Phone when they were still available and I would have liked to try this with that phone.<br /><br />There’s some debate on whether these are on-ear or over-the-ear phones. These are very definitely over-the-ear phones unless your ears are huge. The cups are buttery soft as is the head band, and these are very comfortable. I am able to wear them for long periods of time without fatigue. They do get warm after a while, so keep this in mind.<br /><br />One area a lot of headphones skimp on is the carrying case. The case with these phones is better than average. It is crush resistant and provides good protection for the phones. Included within is an audio cable for input as well as a USB charging cable.<br /><br />These headphones bring a lot to the table and were quite a shock for me. I had much lower expectations, for the ANC function in particular but also for the sound profile. Both exceeded my expectations and the comfort factor is the cherry on top. These are excellent phones and I am very pleased with them.",positive,negative
B08C9WNTF3,5.0,"This camera was absolute plug & play. Within a couple of minutes it was recognized by my computer & discoverable by Zoom as a camera & microphone.  The camera is better than the one on my computer & I was surprised how much more distinct it made my freckles. I tested the HD but didn't use it, mostly because of the freckles. The microphone seems to work well. I can't hear it of course but I haven't received any complaints during the many calls I have used it.<br />My work has been using ZOOM & other platforms for the past few months but there is a push to turn on the cameras to show that the attendees are engaged. So I shaved & started using the camera on my laptop  but it always showed me looking up at my monitor behind the laptop. I clipped this onto the top of my monitor & all is well.<br />The camera has a clamp built in but it doesn't hold all that tight. It hooks on more than it clamps. It does have a 1/4"" threaded insert so it can be mounted to a tripod. I didn't download the recommended software because I'll only use it for these calls & it is working perfectly.",positive,positive

B07W86T94T,5.0,"So I bought this little bundle having lost my wallet 3 times in 2 weeks.... one of the times in another state the night before my return flight!  (found it thank God).<br /><br />Anyway, it's super easy to use the app and was super easy to set up these 4 little items.  I used the card for my purse, the tile with the key chain hole for my car key fob and the 2 little button tiles for 2 of my TV remotes.<br /><br />The point of this review is:  you should know that you can buy just 1 of these things and finding your phone is an added free feature!  Score!  I thought I'd have to attach one of those buttons to the back of my phone, but nope!  So all you do is double tap the Tile logo on any tile and it will locate my phone anywhere within bluetooth range.  This is so totally awesome.  I don't have to log into a computer to find my phone and I don't have to stress out looking for it when my partner's not home to ring my phone from her phone.  All you have to do is double tap ANY Tile you own in bluetooth range and it'll ring your phone.  How great is that???!!  Can't find my phone?  Grab any remote and double tap the logo - BAM!  Can't find my phone?  Grab my purse and double tap the logo on the card Tile - BAM!  Really an A+ feature that Tile should really be clearer about when advertising their products..... like first thing.<br /><br />My review doesn't include how you find things when you're out of bluetooth range..... but I think there's an alert for your phone when you're about to leave your wallet somewhere, etc., or about to exit bluetooth range.... pretty sure that's how it works.  Anyway, just finding my phone and things around the house will save me how many search minutes (hours) a year???

B00EFYJYDQ,5.0,"The motif on the review sample I received is a beautiful example of Mexican folk art. In that respect it's strikingly beautiful and unique. The review sample that I received had a strong chemical odor that was briefly overpowering when I removed the protective cellophane wrapping. I was forewarned about that before the sample arrived. So expect it and do not be alarmed because it dissipates within hours.<br /><br />Aside from the motif and its vivid colors I loved the texture of the outside of the case. It has a fine, pebble gain feel so it will not get slippery on a wet day or if you are sweaty. The plastic holder into which my iPad 2 snapped provides very good protection. It's thick enough to protect the edges of the iPad, but with enough give to cushion shock. Of course, the outer part of the case does an excellent job of cushioning and absorbing shock if you accidentally drop your iPad. On the inside of the front cover are three strips that augment the cushioning across the screen, which is a nice feature that also shows the attention to detail when this case was designed. They are also the slots that allow you to angle your iPad.<br /><br />Other features that I love and which inspired me to give this case five stars are the 360 degree rotation, the three viewing angles that should suit most people, and the cutouts. All of the cutouts were precisely done and even the camera one ensured that nothing interfered with the lens or caused flashback that some cheaply made cases do.<br /><br />I've tested and owned at least a dozen iPad cases and this one is as good as the most expensive ones, but has a design that truly stands out.",positive,positive

B078WT8MH9,5.0,"The laptop arrived in a cardboard box that was a bit mangled, but the LG box is designed to protect the laptop. There's also plastic covers on the brushed metal casing. Set-up is easy as you plug it in and power it on, and the MS assistant 'talks' you through things, allowing you to use voice or keyboard control. It's Windows 10 on the laptop, but no MicroSoft Suite (you have to pay extra for that).<br />With a SSD and 8 RAM memory, everything is very fast and responsive - I can have multiple tabs open on my internet browser, be playing music and have an app or Windows up and nothing is slow at all. It wakes up out of sleep mode quickly, too, and there's a fingerprint sensor for log-in or I can use a pin or 'drawing picture' function (there's lots of security options available).<br />Music/sound - the speakers are on the back/around the hinge, so if you're on a flat surface, the sound is good (it's not a high quality 'music/entertainment' laptop). But if it's on your lap, it may be muffled a little, fair warning.<br />Image/screen - it has good resolution and images are clear/crisp, but due to the fact that it's so lightweight, it's not a glass surface and has a little 'give'. When touching it, it leaves a faint 'trail' behind, but that does fade away quickly.<br />Keyboard - keyboard has some nice 'give' to it and I had to use Fn+F8 to make the backlight work. It didn't light up automatically, but you can turn it on/off and adjust the brightness.<br />There's three USB ports, an HDMI port, one for headphones and a micro SD card and others, split between both sides. That's a nice amount for a new laptop.<br />This is indeed a lightweight computer. It's lighter than my older generation Surface. The touchpad is responsive and the battery does have a good charge (at least for now), depending on what you're using (how many apps, backlight, etc.). All in all, this is a great laptop for work, writing, some entertainment and anything you would need to take on the go due to its light weight and thinness.",positive,negative

B09TPW4XQR,4.0,"I've been watching a bunch of electronics repair videos lately and thinking back at my past purchases and the electronics I threw away, I wondered how many devices I could have rescued.  Determined not to let electronics repair scare me off from tacking them, I decided to start collecting the tools that I need to do my own repairs.<br /><br />I started with an affordable, but well-reviewed soldering iron: the Pinecil.  A good silicone mat (same one as StezStix Fix), and now a microscope.<br /><br />The LLIMINK Digital Microscope 7'' LCD, Coin Microscope is a great product.  In the box, you'll find all of the accessories you'll need to get started, including any cables that you might need.  What I wasn't expecting of this device is that it is actually battery powered and that the battery is removeable (see my pictures) -- very much in line with the Right-To-Repair philosophy.  The remote control was a nice addition as well (taking a picture seems to be only controllable from the remote so make sure you don't lose track of it).<br /><br />The base of the microscope is aluminum with two built-in LED lamps that are separately powered from the microscope itself.  They provide additional lighting from other directions if you need it.  The microscope itself has bright leds that shine directly downward on the board.<br /><br />If the microscope mounted LEDs are causing too much glare, there is a collar that can be fitted to the scope.  It will block the LEDs and instead, reflect them so that the light is indirect.  Kinda like the lamps the dentists use.  You're not blinded by the bulb when you're looking up at those lights.<br /><br />Moving on to the screen, it is a 7"" screen with passable quality.  The viewable angle isn't great but it gets the job done.  Any issues with the screen quality is solved by connecting the included micro-hdmi cable to your monitor.  I've included pictures of both the 7"" screen and the ouptut from my monitor.<br /><br />I've already done a couple of simple projects with the help of this device.  I built a garage door opener and gate opener using microcontrollers that are connected to my home automation system.  I'm building my confidence with electronics and soldering.  Hopefully, I can keep more devices out of landfills by repairing them myself.",positive,negative

B00823170Y,3.0,"The came well packaged, but with only visual images of random possible settings (of every one except the one I needed), it took a few minutes to figure out how to lay it out. No instructions at all. I was left to figure out if I install the bracket behind or in front of the tv mount. In my case I was mounting a TCL 40&#34; LCD with a Vizio 2.0 Soundbar. Laying both items on a solid flat surface is the best way to figure out how best to mount it. I ended up placing the brackets in a manner that allowed me to flush mount the soundbar to the tv, and I don't see the bracket or wires. I laid the bracket on the tv then the articulating mount over the soundbar bracket. If I did it the other way, the brackets would not have lined up over the screw holes.<br />To make the TV mount flat and even, I placed two washers in the upper screw holes of the tv to make up for the thickness of the soundbar brackets that attached to the lower two screw holes on the tv.<br />Overall it looks great, but these brackets probably weren't the best choice for me because the width of the soundbar screws only allowed me to screw the brackets into two holes on the tv instead of four, which I think would have made it more stable. If I push on the soundbar, it will flex backwards a little bit, but I have no actual concern of it falling off.<br />I wish these came with any kind of instructions to guide me to the best possible install. Luckily, I'm smart and made it work.<br />These brackets would have to be about 4 inches longer to make an ideal fit for my situation of widely placed screws on the soundbar, and a narrow VESA pattern of 100*150",positive,negative

B00TF1YDH6,5.0,"The current trend with ear buds is to boost the bass to the point of overpowering the rest of the sound profile. I don’t particularly like bass that is too heavy because it can give me awful headaches. These buds have the bass boosted but it is not over the top.<br /><br />These ear buds are very lightweight and low profile. Smaller than many ear buds I have used they fit in my ears very comfortably. The silicone inserts are soft and do not cause any discomfort, but just as important they create a good seal in the ear canal and as a result they have good passive noise canceling (sound isolation). This is a good sign right out of the package - many ear buds I have tried do not seal properly.<br /><br />The sound profile is the most important aspect of any earphones or ear buds. There are really three areas in the sound profile that merit mention - the highs, the mids and the bass. This set of buds is marketed as heavy bass and that is not completely true. Yes, they do have good bass, but it is not heavily overdriven like most. The bass is a little more front-and-center, not in-your-face, if that makes some sense. The mids are good and the music sounds full as a result, not hollow and depthless. The highs are very bright and clear which is a slight surprise - most ear buds that enhance the bass do so at the expense of the highs, so having a set that had strong bass and highs together is a very nice change of pace.<br /><br />These buds come with a very small carrying case. It is a pinch case and has enough room for just the buds and the replacement silicone inserts. It is a soft plastic case and provides protection only from dirt and moisture (though by no means waterproof) so this is not a case that will help when the buds are crammed in a pocket or backpack.<br /><br />This is a very nice set of ear buds at a very nice asking price. They have a very good sound profile and they are comfortable to wear. Keep these in mind when looking for inexpensive buds and good sound.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

B00085ESA0,4.0,"UPDATE 7/3/2012: When I wrote my initial review these headphones were selling for about $60. As of July 2012 they're now selling for $195. That's absurdly high for these headphones - they're not worth that much. I have no clue what has driven the change in price but unless the price resets to something a lot more reasonable then I suggest looking at other options. These are still good headphones; they're just not $195 headphone quality.<br /><br />My original review follows.<br /><br />---<br /><br />In the lab where I work there are literally hundreds of computers running constantly so there is need for ANC headphones, especially if one wants to listen to music. The gear of choice in said lab is Bose but not everyone is willing to spend $300 for a set of good headphones. Philips offers these headphones which cost a fraction of most other ANC phones and work well enough to make them worthwhile.<br /><br />Because Bose is considered the standard when it comes to ANC phones, I will use them as a reference point.<br /><br />These headphones are a bit smaller than the Bose QC15's, and the way they lay on the ear can be mildly uncomfortable over time when one is used to larger headphones that completely cover the ear. Not everyone will have this problem, though. Some people find these phones to be perfectly acceptable and are content with the soft pads.<br /><br />Sound quality is fine. I have a pair of Sennheisers that have better sound, but Sennheiser is known for their sound quality and are hard to beat. Then again, they tend to be expensive too. When considering the price differential, the quality of sound coming out of the Philips is very satisfying. Unlike Bose, the Philips phones do not overdrive the bass and they provide a more realistic sound.<br /><br />These are noise canceling phones, and with a battery in them they do indeed actively cancel noise. It is not in the same league as Bose, but that is relative - the Bose cost nearly 10 times as much but the ANC is not 10 times better. Overall, Philips does an adequate job of canceling low-frequency noise, to the point that one can listen to music at lower volumes in a noisy environment like a plane. They don't completely knock out all the sound but they kill enough noise to make an appreciable difference.<br /><br />I have only one complaint with these headphones - the cord is not detachable. It would be nice to use them strictly as ANC phones in the lab like the Bose, but unfortunately this is not an option.<br /><br />For those on a more conservative budget or those that refuse to spend a premium for ANC headphones, Philips offers this set for a reasonable price that perform very well for their class. This is one of those weird cases when you actually get more than you pay for.",positive,positive

B009UNZ5WQ,5.0,"I had the opportunity to directly compare my review sample to the [[ASIN:B001EZYMF4 Sennheiser CX 300 II Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds]], which is a highly regarded IEM (in ear monitor) in the same price range. This one actually sounded better to my ears although both were nearly identical in specifications.<br /><br />This is my third Brainwavz phone model, and I have quickly come to regard this brand as a real contender in the market. I will not lie - I much prefer the [[ASIN:B00ENZRS76 Brainwavz HM9 Hi-Fi Noise Isolating Headphones]] model because I love over-the-hear style phones. However, this set of phones, at about a third of the cost, is also close in sound quality as the HM9.  In fact, the bass in this one is much better than the HM9 (or the Sennheiser CX 300 II to which I am directly comparing these.)<br /><br />For me comfort is everything because I listen to music much of my time. These are perfect for both pleasure listening where I sit back and enjoy the music for its own sake. These are also good enough for me to hear every nuance when I am transcribing or studying a track to learn. In that respect these phones are good enough for professional musicians, but I will admit that they would not be my first choice for plugging into a high-end sound system.<br /><br />Since I spend more time listening to MP3 tracks than off vinyl these do the job since MP3 files lose some fidelity by their very nature. I will say, though, that these phones passed my basic test suite, which includes Miles Davis' [[ASIN:B00136JQMI Kind Of Blue]]. That is my reference model for sound because it contains high, mid and low frequency instruments that exercise any sound system. I listened to that album both from CD and from an MP3 file. Reproduction was superb.<br /><br />Not only do these phones have respectable sound and comfort, the package is complete. They come with a zippered hard shell case, which protects the phones. However, they come with more extras that add to the value and provide versatility: a 1/4 adapter for plugging directly into standard headphone jacks, and an airplane adapter.<br /><br />If you are in the market for mid-range IEMs give these serious consideration. In my opinion they are easily the equal of better known brands like the Sennheiser I mentioned and can be a better value if you need the extras that this set includes.",positive,positive

When I run I use over the ear headphones, but I can't fit those on over or under my cycling helmet. These sunglasses are a great solution.

The effect is an open ear speaker system that allows you to hear your music, but also lets you stay mindful of ambient noises.<br /><br />The sunglasses have enough of a tint to be comfortable, but not so much that they are impractical in low light.

But, when I linked it to my phone and listened to a number of tunes that sound and play well with headphones, the sound was terrible.  Virtually everything I played sounded ""muddy"".  I tried adjusting the sound with the equalizer in my audio player (MediaMonkey) and it didn't help much.  I even downloaded the speaker's app and that didn't help either.  I made sure the bass boost was off when doing all of this, so that wasn't the cause.  To make matters worse, while playing many of the songs I head only one channel - the other was extremely faint.  And on one instance, a song that wasn't very bass heavy actually made the speaker ""rattle"".  I'll probably return this speaker also.  It's too bad.  I was considering buying a few for Xmas gifts this year.",negative,negative
B09CGP8MVH,5.0,"I really like this headphone headset because I forget that I'm wearing it.  It fits snug, but with light soft rubber that wraps around your ears and the back of your head.

B0719CV9W2,4.0,"Of the three main GPS receiver manufacturers - Garmin, TomTom and Magellan - I have had the most success with TomTom devices. My first GPS was a TomTom and it served me well for years until the map outgrew the memory. I was excited to have the opportunity to try this one; so far, it has been a good unit, though I do not care for the menu system.<br /><br />This is a larger unit than the original one I had, upgrading from a 4.3"" to a 6"". I like the screen real estate. For all that screen space, TomTom has made good use of it, maximizing the visible map and keeping the interface clean and uncluttered. One area where I am slightly disappointed, though, is in the speed display which is a little small - it's good to keep it out of the way but it's a little smaller than I like and it a bit harder to read. If you use your GPS for watching your speed, this could be a problem.<br /><br />Navigation is easy. I like the way this unit routes me to my destination yet does not nag me when I go off the chosen route. Others I have used (including my old TomTom) would badger me to make a U-turn for a while before deciding that there was another way to get where I was going. This unit does make that point sometimes, but it also is smart enough to reroute when I have multiple similar routes.<br /><br />The biggest plus for this unit (and it seems to be a TomTom thing) is that the voice very clearly enunciates without distortion or the unit buzzing. I have had this issue with every other unit of every other brand, but my old TomTom was clear and understandible even at higher volumes. Since this one is the same, I believe TomTom has a better understanding of how to build a unit that sounds right.<br /><br />Navigating from work to home is usually a straight shot down the interstate for 40+ miles and a little bit of backroads. To test, I instead took a long, out-of-the-way route that I use when there is heavy traffic volume. Knowing it would try to put me on the interstate, I set the farthest point as a first leg, then set it to take me home from there. The route it chose was actually only slightly different than the one I had chosen already, and the difference was that I accounted for rush hour traffic.<br /><br />Speaking of traffic... This unit gathers traffic data without relying on mobile data. I greatly prefer this to having to run an app on my phone and letting it gather traffic info from online. So far I have not had it report a reroute due to traffic; I will come back here and update when it does.<br /><br />The main complaint I have about this GPS is the menu system. WIth TomTom's older units, the menu system was fairly traditional and was smiliar to that of a PC application menu system (sorta). The new interface has a scrolling row of icons that lead to more icons. I am not a fan of this type of interface and is the one thing I would change about this unit if I could.<br /><br />When this unit is first powered on and set up it downloads a hefty amount of data to update the map. This is unavoidable, unfortunately. Do not be discouraged by this - it will be up to date and ready to go when it finishes.<br /><br />I have not had any real issues with this unit so far. It works well and I like how it navigates. I don't like the menu system and find it very awkward, but it gets me where I want to go with little fuss.",positive,positive

I would be able to have it on for maybe 2-8 minutes, then it would notify me that it was at low battery. I'm not exactly sure what happened here, but the left headphone because practically useless.

I used them because I had them...but just now (only 4 months after purchase) They've started turning the volume all the way down on their own randomly. It's very annoying.

B00UB9UJFQ,2.0,"Update: After less than 60 days of owning the TV, the ENTIRE audio panel died. None of the external audio ports work anymore for no reason whatsoever. Worked fine, then boom just stopped working. Thought it was my soundbar, so I bought a new soundbar, but nope, soundbar works just fine when connected to the cable box. Amazon Prime was awesome in helping me return it, and I'll be picking up a more reliable brand. When it came time to purchase a new TV we approached it the same way we approached buying a house. We made a list of the features we wanted (a SmartTV with Wifi, streaming channels, Amazon Prime, 40” and affordable at around the $250 mark). After looking at our options in terms of price and convenience, we decided that it made the most sense to purchase it through Amazon Prime.<br /><br />After much research, we decided that the TCL TV’s offered the best value, met our budget requirements, and our decision to purchase the TV through Amazon enabled us to purchase the TV with interest free financing over 6 months.<br />Appearance.<br />The TV came in a large box with the stand hardware: remote, power cable and batteries plus simple instructions that were in separate bags. You do not get a HDMI or any other cables. The TV has a simple non-fussy design with approximately half inch bezel all around. The stand that comes with it is simple and screws on with two screws at each side. The stand footprint requires about 8.5 inches of depth to stand on. I like that the stand is low profile raising the screen about 2” above the surface it is standing on.<br /><br />Setup<br /><br />The old analog phono inputs are on the back and quite hard to reach once the TV is up on the mantle and they protrude straight out the back which would require more space between the wall and the TV if you use them. The power cable plugs into a recessed area low down on the left side and doesn’t interfere with the location of the tv. All the modern input and output sockets are behind the screen on the right side about 8 inches back. We don’t use any subscription TV service; just a double bowtie antenna mounted on one of the gutter pipes at the back of the house. The coaxial input for the antenna along with three HDMI ports, an optical input, 3.5mm jack and USB socket are all here. We use two of the HDMI sockets one for the 1TB Media hub and the other for our notebook.<br /><br />Once everything is plugged in and turned on. The TV introduces you to the basic setup process. It takes less than five minutes to find your way around. The remote is minimalist with the most basic controls on the front (Volume Up/Down toggle and mute buttons on the side). It’s small, unfussy and easy to use. The UI for the TV is not flashy but functional and easy to navigate. Setting up WIFI, registering your TV and introducing you to streaming channels and how to add them to your desktop are covered quickly and then you are left to your own devices.<br /><br />Since we are just using an antenna we were initially a little apprehensive. Wondering how well that would work, or even if the TV had a tuner since everyone seems to use dish or cable these days. It has a tuner that works flawlessly. We managed to pick up almost 3 dozen channels many of them HD. A quick look online showed us a map of where the broadcast towers are and helped us aim our antenna for best reception.<br /><br />In use.<br /><br />The TV has a really nice clean picture and since it is an LED TV where a grid array of LED's light the screen uniformly rather than a couple of fluorescent lamps there is practically no limit to the viewing angle. The screen is not high gloss and prevents reflection and most glare from bright light sources. When turned on a non invasive 3” horizontal strip of illuminated plastic at the bottom shows you the TV is powered on. It flashes during startup and goes out when the screen is illuminated.<br /><br />Image<br /><br />Image quality is excellent BUT on initial setup it is on a bright echo setting. Which is very high contrast and overly saturated. I guess it is a power saving mode (claimed 16 watts) but it is a bit stark and overwhelming and shows some dithering on smooth color transitions as though it is running at a lower bitrate with fewer colors. When turned to theater mode the quality of the picture is MUCH better with very smooth transitions on subtle colour gradients.<br /><br />Sound<br /><br />Sound is similar. Like most LCD style TV’s this one comes with tiny speakers. Again the default sound setting seems to be very flat. Probably to conserve energy. There are about four presets and again we went with theater which gives the broadest range and warm midtones without overdoing the bass. It doesn’t sound too bad and is not thin and reedy like the default setting.<br /><br />Smart TV functionality.<br /><br />We originally wanted WIFI because as Amazon Prime members we get a lot of free on demand media. This is similar to Netflix where you can watch a huge catalog of TV and movies for free, buy or rent them for a small fee. The same goes with music. This worked perfectly.<br /><br />What we weren’t expecting was the sheer volume of streaming media available for free via WIFI. There are hundreds of channels, many of them free to choose from, many mainstream ones that let you view their current episodes of popular shows on demand when you want to watch them. You can also sign up for pay for view services like HBO and showtime individually.<br /><br />One nice thing is that the TV has a global search option. You can search for anything by title, director, actors name, character, keywords and the TV will find everything relating to your search and list what is available by channel. So you can easily pick out what you want to see.<br /><br />Mobile devices and streaming from those devices<br /><br />There are apps for Android and iOS as well as Windows. I was able to control the TV from all our devices. In many ways it is more responsive, especially if you need to type in text. If you have media on your PC there are Apps for the TV that will let you stream from your phone, notebook, desktop computer etc.<br /><br />Streaming from those devices tends to work ok. I did find that the TV’s built-in media player was a little limited in supported data formats. Setting up our digital media hub with its own channel was very easy and luckily our Western Digital media hub has far more extensive support for many of the more exotic file formats like FLAC lossless digital audio. And other formats are more often limited to computers. The TV does support the more mainstream formats like mp3, mpg, jpg etc.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />For us, this TV proved to be a very good and affordable purchase. Especially when you factor in the 6 months interest fee financing Amazon offers prime members. We did sign up for a free month of Netflix too. The remote has a dedicated Netflix and Amazon streaming button. But we were not that impressed with Netflix when our Amazon Prime membership offered all the same features and more thanks to the addition of Amazon Prime music.<br /><br />When you combine all this TV’s features with our media hub and Amazon Prime we are a bit overwhelmed with the sheer amount of stuff out there to watch. Even if we had no antenna and just a WIFI internet connection. The vast number of free streaming HD channels is extensive making the need for TV subscription plans pretty much obsolete unless you have a very specific need.<br /><br />We really like this TV and highly recommend it.",negative,negative
B0BNB4L6JF,3.0,"This Bluetooth speaker came well packaged and on time.<br /><br />Pros: Great sound from a small speaker. Easy to setup. And connect to all my Bluetooth devices.<br /><br />Cons: It has a very musk-y smell. Like it was manufactured in a barn or farm yard. (I know what this smells like considering where I live.) (-2 stars) Very overpowering.<br /><br />Overall I had to Fabreze It, before using it do to the barnyard smell. Once you get past the smell, it does have a pretty good sound from a small speaker. It has a 5 hour battery life. It also warns you to not use it in a humid area, or to get it wet so be advised. If you are looking for one that is water proof i would recommend a JBL one.

B00GNRI1ZK,5.0,"This is a great way to use HDMI devices on TVs that have no spare HDMI ports or are not equipped with one. I tested the review sample that I received on a 2008 Sanyo TV that came equipped with two HDMI ports that I quickly occupied with a Roku and a Chromecast, and with a 2011 model Samsung. Both displayed the transformed signal from this box beautifully.<br /><br />It has come excellent features like the array of color encoding schemes and outputting either the most common PAL and NTSC ones with the flip of a switch. I also love that this is powered via USB, which one of my TVs as, so it's one less wall wart.<br /><br />Do be aware that this only converts in one direction: HDMI in (from Blu-Ray players, etc) to composite out via RCA jacks on a TV or monitor. I tested this going the other direction - RCA to HDMI - and it did not work. Of course it was not advertised as such, but I felt compelled to try anyway. I would love it if I could flip a switch and change directions of the signal transformation because I could then connect my old VHS player to an HDMI port on my TV.<br /><br />Regardless of my personal wishes, this does exactly what it claims with no problems or issues, and that merits five stars according to how I rate.",positive,positive

B01LZV6TYQ,5.0,"First off, I am not an audiophile. This is a review from a simple person who wanted music at work.<br /><br />I am a Rural Carrier for the United Stated Postal Service. I deliver mail in an LLV truck and these vehicles are basically mobile tin cans. Every panel rattles, making for quite an unpleasant environment, audio wise. I tried playing music directly off my phone, but alas my speakerphone is only so loud and is constantly drowned out by the LLV.<br /><br />So, I researched Bluetooth speakers and, based on the reviews and popularity, recently purchased two:<br />-[[ASIN:B016XTADG2 Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker with 24-Hour Playtime, 66-Foot Bluetooth Range &amp; Built-in Mic, Dual-Driver Portable Wireless Speaker with Low Harmonic Distortion and Superior Sound - Black]]<br />-[[ASIN:B01LZV6TYQ OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Splashproof Bluetooth Speaker - Designed &amp; Engineered by Cambridge SoundWorks for Richer Bass, HD Sound, and 30-Hour Playtime, 10W+ Power, Water Resistant, Portable Wireless Speaker]]<br /><br />The Anker SoundCore is being returned while I am keeping the OontZ Angle 3 Plus and here is why.<br /><br />I tested both speakers in my home at first. My very first impression, out of the box:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus -  was nice to touch and just felt solid and very well built.<br />Anker SoundCore - just felt like a simple lightweight brick. It really didn't give the impression of longevity or durability.<br /><br />The set-up guides were quite different from each other.<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - Extremely easy to read, follow and understand (remember, I am not a music nut lol. This was my first time ever using a Bluetooth speaker and was in completely uncharted territory.) It was all in English, and only English and the diagrams were detailed and made the entire set-up process seamless and carefree.<br />Anker SoundCore - This guide was very hard to follow. It is printed in darn near every language, in tiny print and the diagrams were quite small as well. I ultimately did get the speaker paired with my phone and figured out what buttons did what, but it took nearly 15 minutes to do so.<br /><br />Bluetooth Pairing<br />With both speakers and my phone lined up on a table (well within the proximity specified in each set-up guide), both speakers paired, however:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - MUCH faster in pairing (mere seconds!).<br />Anker SoundCore - took nearly two minutes to complete the pairing process.<br /><br />Pause/Play Button<br />Since I dismount to deliver packages to a customer's door routinely on my route, I really need to have a simply way to pause my music. I really like how both speakers offer this function on directly on the units, saving me from having to handle my phone.<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - I barely press the Play/Pause button and the speaker immediately reacts. There is NO hesitation.<br />Anker SoundCore - I press the Play/Pause button and there is a delay of about 5 seconds.. just long enough to make me think I didn't press hard enough and reach to do it again only for the speaker to finally react.<br /><br />Volume/Overall Playback Quality<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - Wow. Just wow. It is truly unbelievable to hear such full sound, and bass(!), coming from such a small unit. I found myself perfectly pleased with the output without ever reaching max volume on the speaker itself. So I am looking forward to how well it will work in my LLV during my first road test. As for now, I am thoroughly impressed!<br />Anker SoundCore - I maxed out the volume on my phone and the speaker and was just not impressed. If I could guess, I'd say the max output this speaker achieved was only about 25% more than my speakerphone alone (while the OontZ Angle 3 Plus blew it out of the water with close to double, if not more, output than my speakerphone alone).<br />I also noted some kind of distortion or interference type background sound with the Anker SoundCore at mid volume and above.<br /><br />Speakerphone/Mic<br />I was able to answer an incoming phone call on both units as described in each set-up guide. The quality of in-call sound on each speaker differed:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - My husband's (the caller) voice was crisp and clear, as if he was sitting talking right next to me. There was no distortion or feedback out of the speaker. Husband reported nothing but a clear voice on his phone.<br />Anker SoundCore - Husband's voice was clear, but echoed horribly. No matter what volume level I used. There was no distortion (I was expecting this given the distortion with the music playback) bu the continuous echoing is a major issue for me. Husband reported a slight &quot;faded&quot; type of echo on his phone.<br /><br />Road Test (in my LLV)<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - The sound is amazing in the truck! Thinking I would need it, I maxed the volume on both the speaker and my phone then pressed play on my music. Well, I certainly don't need max volume. I reduced the volume on both the speaker and my phone and found a very happy medium output. This speaker performs perfectly in the loud, rattling setting of a USPS LLV.. even while bouncing down rural dirt two tracks and washboard gravel roads. I am extremely pleased with this tiny speaker.<br />Anker Soundcore - Even with maxed volume settings, I could not get this speaker to perform anywhere near as well as the OontZ Angle 3 Plus. It had volume and was loud enough to hear over the vehicle's own noise, however the distortion/interference mentioned earlier was still present and in the truck during the road test it had what I would describe as an echoing effect on the music, specifically the singers' voices. It just wasn't clear. (I hope that makes sense.)<br /><br />Battery Life/Listen While Charging<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - So far, the battery life is impressive. After receiving it, I charged it overnight (as recommended). I then had it connected to my phone for about an hour of home testing. Turned it off and I next used it at work on a Saturday.. had it powered on and connected to my phone and actively playing music for about 5.5 hours. I then used it again on Monday (much longer and busier days in the USPS, FYI).. had it on, connected and active continuously for nearly 9 hours. I have yet to see the low battery light come on. I plan to see just how many days of work I can get out of a single charge.<br />Anker Soundcore - I have no information for this section on this speaker since I am returning it.<br /><br />Exterior/Cleaning<br />At first, I had the OontZ Angle 3 Plus setting on the dashboard of the LLV. This didn't last more than two stops. Despite having the four rubber &quot;feet&quot;, the speaker still slid around causing more of a distraction than I would like. I ended up setting it on top of my personal bag, in a bin by my feet with the speaker facing up. This move really helped my piece of mind, knowing it will not go anywhere. This speaker has a soft rubber exterior. It is quite nice and feels luxurious, however... this exterior attracts all dust particles within 50 feet! USPS LLVs are *not* known for being the cleanest and even though I moved the speaker from the dust-ridden dashboard to a bin, it was still slathered with dust and dirt by the end of my route. I figured it was a fair trade, sacrificing the appearance for the gain of having decent music. But.. I got home and went to clean it. I will tell you, my expectations of this working were very low. I didn't think the dust would come off that supple rubber. But with a wet paper towel and a few slow wipes, it did. So, it can be cleaned up!<br /><br />Case<br />I did purchase the case for this speaker ([[ASIN:B01NBDY6VP [Official] OontZ Angle 3 Plus Bluetooth Portable Speaker Carry Case, Neoprene with Aluminum Carabiner, reinforced zipper, by Cambridge SoundWorks [NOT FOR OontZ Angle 3]]]). I was mainly wanting a safe way to transport and store the speaker, but after reading the other reviews I was hoping I would be able to keep it clean in the case and still enjoy my music on my route. I received the case and used it yesterday. The case is extremely nice and I appreciate the interior mesh pocket. I have no need for it now, but I'm sure it will come in handy if I ever take this speaker on vacation and need to take the charging cables along. As for playback while in the case? Yeah, it was terribly muffled. It didn't work for me as it apparently has for others. Yet, the case itself is exactly what I was wanting for taking it to and from work. It is not as thickly padded as I would have expected, however it does protect the speaker.<br /><br />Overall, for my specific purpose and intended use for a Bluetooth speaker, the Anker SoundCore simply won't cut it. However, it is still a nice speaker and will perhaps fit your needs perfectly. After all, most people don't drive LLVs and have the same high demands that go along with that. For me, the OontZ Angle 3 Plus is what I'll be bopping down the road to, mailbox to mailbox.<br /><br />Happy hunting! Hope this review helps you out!",positive,negative

It is relatively easy to find song genres and individual songs.  The FM transmitter sound quality is excellent.  Although the Bluetooth connectivity also is good, the microphone is really bad.  Callers and those I call regularly complain about the poor quality of my voice.  I think the microphone is too small and just too far away from my mouth (on the console).  It might work better for cars where the cigarette lighter socket is close to one's face.  Although this is a nuisance, the Bluetooth capability was a secondary consideration for me.  I use it the device almost exclusively for music and it is great!",positive,negative
B074HYNMWG,5.0,"I selected this mouse with the thought that it would be a good travel mouse. I like the feature set, specifically the ability to recharge the mouse instead of replacing the batteries. So far, I have had no issues with this mouse. In the price range, it’s a good one.<br /><br />The mouse comes in a little mesh bag which sets it up nicely for use as a travel mouse. I can toss the whole in my bag and the USB dongle will stay with it even if it slips off the mouse.<br /><br />The mouse quickly connects once the dongle is plugged in, and I have not had any trouble with it. It’s responsive and does not skip or stutter.<br /><br />One of the things about this mouse that stands out to me is actually the shape. Most mice are somewhat arched but do not have enough arch to fit my hand properly. This one is much more arched than most. I still prefer my trackball, but I do not have any issue with using this mouse because the fit in my hand causes less cramping for me.<br /><br />Charging this mouse is fast and easy. It comes with a USB cable and it charges up quickly when plugged in. I have not drained the mouse all the way down and recharged it so I cannot say for sure yet how long it takes to charge it up from empty.<br /><br />I had forgotten how nice it is to have a side-scrolling mouse...<br /><br />This is an inexpensive mouse but that doesn’t mean it’s cheap. It works well and it seems to be well designed. It’s rechargeable which means no spending on batteries, it’s shaped nicely to fit the hand a little better than many and it connects quickly.",positive,positive

B07G82MKCY,2.0,Very dissatisfied.  It doesnt hold up to any of the sellers claims.  Unless its ambient background noise.  It will pick up a normal talking voice at 5 feet away. After that your tv and DVR has to be max volume to even try n hear a conversation.  This will work perfectly if your trying to use DIRECTLY at your front door.  Other than that dont waste your money.  Compared to cameras with audio this doesnt hold a candle to pick up ability.<br />AND a bigger problem its sold as weather proof BUT SAYS you have to protect from rain and snow. WTF is that all about?  Weather proof is exactly that there is no in between.<br />I'm sending both units back asap and plan on spending 50$ for something that will actually work the right way. Total waste of my time.,negative,negative

This is a pretty cool device! The only complaint I have if any is that there is no cover over the cd as it's playing. You just lightly touch the turning disc to stop it .

The iJoys are one of the most comfortable set of headphones I've worn.  I have a larger than normal noggin and these fit on my head, as well as my daughter's w/o slipping or pinching.

B09NXCM7X8,4.0,"Wow, these inexpensive fitness tracker watches have really come a long way! I've used WearOS, Fitbit, Galaxy and Amazfit brand watches, and usually find the cheap ones are cute for my kids but not very accurate or full of mostly gimmicky features.<br />This one actually looks and acts a lot like a cheaper version of my current Amazfit GTS3 watch. The way the menu works, the way the app works... it's all very familiar. Granted, this watch does not have the high resolution OLED display that my Amazfit does, but the display is capable of vivid colors and looks great!<br /><br />The accuracy is surprisingly spot on, I even tested my heart rate with this and other smartwatches I own since usually there's a lot of discrepancy, and it often lined up exactly. Steps were interesting- most smartwatches don't count steps unless you move for more than a few steps at a time (disregarding a step here or there as an error). This one goes a step further and actually refused to count steps I made unless I was WEARING THE WATCH! I'm not sure if this is a attempt to prevent cheaters from shaking their watch or something, but I noticed it would not count any of my steps when I held it in my fingers, but when I put it on my wrist, it counted! Perhaps there is a proximity sensor on the back of the watch, I'm not sure. This might be a problem for those who occasionally put the watch in a pocket or something to get steps if, for example, pushing a shopping cart (since your wrist doesn't move, pushing strollers and carts tend to not count anyway- one workaround is to put the watch in a pocket but that might not work now).<br /><br />Another thing I wish it had is a better notification system. Certain apps which aren't in their list of known notifications won't work correctly (Google Voice, for example). But that's true of all cheap tracker watches. It also can't install apps or extend functionality like the more expensive ones. There is definitely a reason my regular watch costs 5-6x as much as this one, but for what it is on a budget, honestly, it's pretty amazing!",positive,negative

It’s too many steps each time to make it functional, but I think the worst thing is it won’t even play music that is locally on my phone!

This speaker, for the past couple of months, has been great!  Easy to operate!  I don't turn on the side lights because they're so distracting.  I wish they'd have a tiny little dot of a light on it though because sometimes I can't tell if I turned it off or not.  There were days that I thought it was off and walked away, only to come back to a speaker that had been on for over 48 hours.  This speaker does not create static noises even though my phone is right next to it with incoming calls.  It's totally worth the price.",positive,positive

B088BFCPJM,5.0,"I was looking for an adjustable desk that I could use with my laptop when working on the couch or in bed and this product has worked perfectly.<br /><br />Prior to this I was using a traditional lap desk with a padded base which worked but each time I moved it shifted everything on the desk’s surface.  This product fit what I needed perfectly.<br /><br />The table is completely adjustable in height and tilt, allowing for it to be used whether seated or while laying down.  Having the ability to easily raise and lower the legs makes it where you can always have the surface where you need it and allow for adequate clearance beneath.<br /><br />The surface provides plenty of space for both my laptop and mouse without feeling cramped.<br /><br />Having the built in fan is a great addition as it helps keep my laptop cool without my needing to move my laptop fan base from my normal workstation.<br /><br />This has been the perfect laptop desk for working away from my workstation whether I’m sat on the couch or laying in bed.  During these COVID days, like many, I’m working all over the place so it’s nice having tools that make that a bit easier.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.  I enjoy writing them as I value reading other’s reviews when I’m making a buying decision.

The problem however is if you wanted to use this for a headset with an inline mic for calls, this is NOT the adapter for you. The mic channel is not carried and it only uses the mic on the phone in my tests.<br />If that's not a requirement for you, it's great for just normal headphones.",positive,negative
B00KGEXXOK,5.0,"For its size and price, this is an amazing little device. This thing is tiny and pretty easy to conceal. I only wish it came with some type of bracket to help mount in a vehicle. It has a very strange shape and some grooves on the side which appear like they were designed for some type of bracket to slide into. Ultimately, I will probably make something.<br /><br />Video quality on the highest quality is amazingly good. It even does pretty well in low light conditions. Better than some similar devices I've tried. It has some default modes that will work without the widget, but you pretty much need to download and use it to take advantage of all its features. The widget seems pretty well designed and is fairly intuitive. I've had no problems using it. Audio could be better and in some situations it works pretty well, while other time its almost unintelligible. I believe this is just the nature of the little pinhole mike pick up. Results will vary based on the situation. I have found that sometimes the audio appears out of sync, but I'm not sure that doesn't have something to do with playback software. On the best quality, the files are pretty big and it will keep a processor busy watching the video.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great little package that includes cables, power pack and just about everything you'll need except the mini SD card. Some of the earlier mini DVRs were poor quality and lacked features as well as cost a lot for the size convenience. This device takes the mini DVR to a whole new level that is light years beyond some of the earlier stuff. Having tried many other little minis, I can say that this just blows them all away and clearly has been developed to a much more advanced level.<br /><br />Once you have played with it for awhile, you'll find endless uses. With a bit of creativity, concealment is pretty easy and battery life is quite good.",positive,positive

B07DW4NWQB,5.0,"Well.. I needed to find a headset that could perform double duty. Not ever purchasing a Bluetooth/noise canceling headset before I wasn’t sure what to expect! To say the least.. I had to rely on reviews and what I found sounded promising!<br /><br />The sound is better than expected. Being one<br />who was born in the 70’s.. I actually was around when this style of headset made its rocking debut for the first time- Let’s just say.. the sound/fit and quality have reached new heights!! DON’T anyone be fooled by the retro throwback style.. this is a fit that is actually comfortable now and not, head throbbing tight on the temples- or, tweaking ones<br />ear due to the cup made to fit.. Um?! Oh yeah, made to fit no one.. !! Instead these have enough stretch to make it feel nice and adjust in height/angle. I will say- there’s a wee bit of ear sweat bc, the material used doesn’t breathe 100%.. Yet, I'm sure it must be necessary to create a better sound quality!<br /><br />I won’t lie...These aren’t featherweight as if, you could just forget you have them on- but, You can definitely notice the attention to detail that went into making these ergonomically shaped and the care in using light weight material. Where I noticed the weight of the headset most, is when I’d lean my head forward to look at my phone (interesting- we all look down to use our phone- we don’t ever bring our phone up?!) But, doing this I could feel the weight in back of my neck.. Now, I’m sure after using these a few times, you would build up those muscles pretty quick! But, just Something to keep in mind-<br />First need was to take on road trip so, I could hear music I liked. Sound itself was not like anything I’d ever heard and I know, it sounds ignorant but- if this isn’t your thing.. how Would you know what to expect?!! Yesss!!! I have used earphones before..<br />ie. On a plane or, book on tape at the pool, etc.. Style used is the type that slips into the ear and plugs into a device. I’ve also used AirPod before as well.. But, with this Srhythm or, as I like to call it- “retro” headset.. Best way to describe differences to a lament like myself: Imagine watching a movie at home on a regular TV vs. watching the same movie in a kick-butt dolby theater with surround, upgrades, whistles and bells! Either will suffice. But, knowing the difference- Why would you ever want anything less.. HeLLo!!!<br />The Noise canceling option is just a flip of a button and I’m wondering why these aren’t a mandatory gift for parents bringing newborns home from the hospital! They don’t make every sound disappear, rather.. they deafen the noise to let you think and concentrate- this was my other need in getting this headset. I have the hardest time typing emails and papers with verbal conversation happening around me… Knowing this is a weakness, I wanted to try this novel concept- and Wow! it’s perfect for what I need- I’m sold and a total fan!!! It takes out all the noise clutter yet, let’s you hear needed sounds if necessary. If you have this issue- try this, you won’t be disappointed.<br />I’ll admit hooking into Bluetooth was intimidating so, my kiddos did it for me in about 2 seconds. (I don’t care enough about certain things to learn it myself…) The ability to use all options this offers will prob. be too much and not fall in my wheel house- but, for those who want extras.. these have them! Or, you can choose to use in simplest form and be happy with your purchase. After pricing against others brands of the same quality.. these are hands down the best deal.. if you buy, Im sure these won’t disappoint!!",positive,positive
B00PMO19DQ,5.0,"I received this as a review sample. I had low expectations regarding the sound quality, but was pleasantly surprised. In particular, the mid range response is rich and full, with a decent high end that does not break up, and a low end that turned out to be unexpectedly boomy. Not in your face boomy, but not anemic either.<br /><br />Also, this paired and connected easily to my Note 3 phone. I did not make test calls with it so cannot credibly discuss that feature. I also only wear it occasionally and normally for an hour or two in the evening or morning if I am outside, so cannot validate the battery life claims. Even if those are in the ballpark (and I suspect they are) then their specs are excellent for any speaker in this price range.<br /><br />Finally, the cap keeps my head and ears warm in thirty and forty degree weather, which we actually have in central and north Florida  Granted it is not many days out of the year, but when we do have sub thirty degree weather a cap such as this is greatly appreciated, and is a key feature in my opinion.<br /><br />Regarding the speakers protruding as claimed by another reviewer, that is true to a point. But they do not look horrible (or not to me anyway). My high rating is based on the sound quality, ease of pairing and play time, and the fact that they keep my ears warm.",positive,positive
B012FRTBBE,4.0,"Smart watches have gotten more popular with the release of the Apple watch. They tend to have a standard set of functions, such as access to instant messaging, email, time, alarms and a lot more, typically tied to your phone. Not all smart watches are alike, though, and offer different sets of functions, better connectivity and other various differences from one another. This particular smart watch offers the mainline set of functions, setting itself apart through the user interface which is more polished and clean than most others with which I have worked. That said, I have a couple of quibbles with it, leaving room for a little improvement.<br /><br />This is a standard-sized watch with a rubber wristband that can actually fit a larger wrist like mine. I have trouble finding watches and watch bands that fit me, so the fact that this one fits me is a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Powering it on, the user is immediately greeted with a complex and fairly complete visual menu system with tiles for every function available to the user. This is a standard presentation for a smartwatch, but this one looks a bit more polished and clean than the others I have seen. Switching to other menu screens just requires a swipe gesture, as to be expected. I have big hands, and this means that, for me, using a stylus makes working with this watch a lot easier. This is not the fault of the watch but a reality of working with a small device.<br /><br />My first issue with this watch came when I paired it to my phone. The date and time on the watch were off, so I expected that it would grab the time from my iPhone when I paired it. It did not. Instead, I had to dig for the clock application and manually set the time. I dislike this and think that having it set itself when it is paired is much more accurate and cuts effort on the part of the user. For Android users, there is an application to allow for syncing up the time, date and more, but iOS users are out of luck for now. To the manufacturer's credit this is made clear on the product listing so this is not a surprise. Regardless, I am of the opinion that the watch should fetch the time, not rely on being sent the time. In the grand scheme of things, though, this is an annoyance, not a deal breaker.<br /><br />There is a fairly comprehensive list of functions provided by this watch in addition to time/date and phone answer. Through the menus the user has access to call logs and function, Bluetooth functions, a remote finder function, a pedometer, a sleep monitor, a reminder function to get up and move on occasion, calendar and clock functions, audio functions, video functions and a few more.<br /><br />One of the interesting functions that this watch offers is a camera. So, I tried to use it and it complained that there was no memory card available. Reading through the limited documentation included, I was unable to find anything about a memory card. I finally noticed that the back of the watch has a small groove where it can be popped off, and when I removed the back I found the battery which is removable (replaceable - another pleasant surprise). Under the battery is a slot for a micro SD card.<br /><br />Adding a memory card comes with a big catch. It requires removing the battery to get at the holder which in turn clears the clock and resets it to midnight 01-01-2015. So, adding the memory card requires me to set the time again. And again if I remove the card.<br /><br />Although I think the time sync functions of this watch are lacking, it is otherwise a good smartwatch. The interface is professional and polished and the whole provides access to a large number of useful functions. It's priced well too. Overall, this is a solid offering worth a look if you are wanting a smartwatch.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no/minimal cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",positive,positive

If you plan on taking it with you or playing it in the car for a while I would bring the charger (which is a wall charger, not usb). I wish there was a usb port so I could charge it in the car.  The charger port on the back of the speaker is just trash. There are days when we want to listen to the speaker but it's dead because the charger isn't charging it. The cord comes out of the charging port constantly. I see this being the reason it's unusable very soon.

B089B4CFSC,5.0,"You NEED these if you have AirPods Pro. The earbuds are great but there is a crucial flaw, they fall out of my ears easily despite tip size.

Once it happened in a restaurant. Thank goodness for the quick reactions of our waiter! He saved me $200. While I am relieved, this is seriously not a laughable situation.<br /><br />Thank goodness a product like this. Since I have purchased them (8.99 for FOUR pairs) I have NOT lost my earbuds once! These are comfortable and easily taken off and put back on since the case will not close with them on. If you just need a quick charge you can leave them on and they will charge with the lid open.

B013OKX8II,5.0,"I received this as a free review sample. This is NOT a bluetooth device. These phones are strictly for 3.5mm stereo connections. That means that this will work with a wider variety of devices.<br /><br />The sound quality to my ears is why I awarded it five stars. There is definitely a crossover built into these phones because I could hear the separation of low and high frequencies, with a prominent bass in one ear. Also, there does not seem to be any compression at the high end of the frequency spectrum, which gives these phones a more natural sound. I listen to mainly acoustic jazz (piano jazz trios, vocalists, and similar), so I appreciate the realistic sound these phones provide.<br /><br />There are a few areas that I would love to see improved: the cable is long and would be nicer if it were flat, tangle-proof. Also, the controls are a little too high up on the cable in my opinion. I can easily reach them, but when testing them I could not see the buttons. Of course, those are not show stoppers - just my own preferences. And regarding the controls, I already am familiar with their placement from use and memory, so that is really a non issue.<br /><br />The phones are comfortable. They ship with small, medium and large tips and I used the ones that were already installed. The fit was perfect. These also ship with an extra set of premium, noise blocking tips. I have not tried them since the regular tips are more than adequate for me.<br /><br />Other nice features are the zippered, hard case, velcro cable wrap and shirt clip. To be sure, they are value-added items, but the real value is the sound quality and these phones have that without a doubt.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you want hard wired phones that allow you to listen critically to music (or transcribe it), this is a surprisingly inexpensive solution. I have used everything from high end studio in-ear monitors and premium phones, and these come close at a much more affordable price. I am not saying that these are as good as the expensive phones, but am saying that bang for your buck these are hard to beat and will surprise most audiophiles.",positive,positive
B014VHVZFQ,5.0,"WOW!  I've had this for about a month now and it is really great!  Use this when I work from home or I am on the road. Blazing fast.  Light as a feather. Easily connected to Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.  The dongles work perfectly.  At home I have extended the desktop to the ASUS IPS monitor - no problem. Sound is really good.  I have not had any  problem with the location of the power button or keyboard layout that other reviewers experienced. This is a great work-box for me. My 'work' computer was my HP Envy, which is a great laptop.......I find myself using the Zenbook more and more when working at home. This has also replaced my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 as my 'mobile' tablet. So light and thin; easy to take with.<br /><br />PROS<br />Super, super fast - this is the most responsive laptop I have ever owned<br />Incredibly light and thin - so portable, you will take it with you all the time.<br />super responsive keyboard & touchpad<br />touchpad auto-disconnects when Bluetooth mouse is enabled(sweeeeeeeet)<br />Easy to extend desktop with a VGA dongle<br />Connected Bluetooth devices perform perfectly - no drag at all<br />WIN10 is pre-installed<br /><br />CONS<br />The power supply is a large, square 'plug' that covers at least 2 of the outlets on your surgestrip. Terrible design  :-(<br />Dont buy if primary use will be Video streaming - glass screen is like a mirror/glare is a problem with video - difficult to find a video glare-free angle<br />There is a known WIN10 issue where pop-up dialog boxes are super-small and are extremely difficult to use. Microsoft is working on it<br />The first thing you should do is uninstall Macafee (pre-installed) - blocks so many apps., including Chrome (sigh)<br /><br />UPDATE 03/29/2017<br />Just an FYI - I use this daily and love it, however I am now noticing the battery is getting hot after an hour or so of use. This is a new development. I am not sure what is causing this, but did want to share. I think I may have to shell out some cash for a new battery, which would be unfortunate. I have never had a laptop battery heat up like this before and have never had to replace a laptop battery.  Not sure if others are having the same issue, over time.",positive,positive

I haven't really had occasion to use the keyboard too much, but when I have used it, there were no unpleasant surprises, such as text not showing up on the screen.  I do plan to use it while traveling, and already can say that for protracted iPad use, like responding to emails, I'm going to like it much better than the onscreen keyboard.  The  only issue I have encountered is that I haven't figured out how to make the on screen keyboard go away.  It just pops up, covering half the screen,which is an annoying intrusion.  I'm sure there must be something in settings to deal with this issue, or maybe the product's website,but I just haven't taken the time to find the answer yet.",positive,negative

B007R6HUEE,5.0,"I bought this product because I always feel like my tablet is never loud enough when I want to watch movies. This speaker is awesome. Of course it's not surround sound, but it definitely has some juice!<br /><br />Downside: I could argue that the 4 hour charge isn't very long, but I have an outlet that connects to a USB and think that is a great remedy to still use the speaker and help it with it's charge. The biggest thing is just not to forget that it needs charged so you aren't surprised when it won't turn on.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY: It's actually really good. Even when you turn it up, there's no distortion or at least none that I have noticed just yet, and it really does reach pretty far. I'm not concerned about how far it can connect really because you still want the speaker near you usually, unless your listening to music and want to leave your device in another room... Overall, great buy!",positive,positive
B08CXXJWFP,5.0,These headphones were very nice. They were easy to use. They were comfortable for my daughter. I really like that they have in line control mute. The quality was good. They worked great. We used them for virtual school. They were attractive. I would recommend them.,positive,positive
B07MWCNR3W,5.0,"Great earphones. I use them like every day. As long as you take care of them and clean them out and stuff, they'll last you a good while. The sound quality is good and I love all the functions it has. Plus, the app that goes with it that you automatically have in a Samsung phone makes it even better. You can change the functions and equalizer among other things. I recommend getting a case for these though, as the case is smooth, so it can slip out of your grip or whatever and they can fall. Getting a case for these is a good investment. Aside from that, I don't really have any cons. Great headphones. Convenient, and have a good battery life.",positive,positive
B07C4PNW7W,4.0,"Trying to write a review on these is a little tough because I there is some good and not so good. I think the quality of the materials is fine, the end pieces have magnets in them so if they are hanging around your neck they stay together so you won't lose them. Stays in your ears pretty good, but not really noise canceling at all. The on/off button, connecting and volumes are all good and easy to use. The range is not very good past 15-20ft or walls in an apartment if you move a lot. Fine if you keep your phone with you. The rectangular pieces (volume button/mic) that sits around your neck feels a little weighty and it's fine if you are just sitting at your desk, but not for working out. It pulls, and moves and you have to do a lot of readjusting. Sound quality is not terrible, but not great. 1 being the worst, 10 being the best; Sound 5, noise canceling, 4, comfort, 6, distance, 3, design, 4. These would be okay to have as a second pair if you are stationary, listening to audio books.",positive,negative

B083Z6M497,5.0,"This is a beautiful Photography Ball. It's so pretty I'm storing it in my curio cabinet. Unfortunately, my camping-at-the-beach vacation had to be canceled, so those photos will come from the future. The case for it is brilliant. I like that a clip is on the case, so it can easily attach to a gear backpack. It's nice that the tripod, adapter and polishing cloth is included in a foam cushioned box. This makes for an excellent presentation as a gift. The adapter will allow you to use the included table-top tripod, or any other tripod.<br /><br />These also make awesome photos for doing some differently composed portrait photography. It's a lot of fun to just play around with it and see what happens. Also, it's pretty enough to simply display in the home.<br /><br />I find this to be a very fair value. The ball is nice, clear and free of defects. It's exactly what I was expecting and I'm not at all disappointed.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.

B000F41WGM,5.0,"Quick review:<br /><br />We just had an alarm system upgrade and the whole system was replaced. I told the installer and company installing the alarm I didn't want any false alarms via motion sensor!! Well 3 false alerts later all via the motion sensor I looked into a replacement motion sensor myself and I found this model with dual detect.<br /><br />My installer came out swap out his garbage with the Optex MX40PI and now we just had to wait and see if this motion sensor would trigger any false alarms..... 3 months later no issues, no false alarms and works like a champ. We have cats and 2 of them are larger size and like to run around like crazy in the house and no issues, so we are very happy with this unit !!<br /><br />So if your having the same issue I was with the cheap motion sensors installed, replace them with these Optex MX40PI and you will be happy campers.

B07TYYP62B,4.0,Sound quality is excellent at least for me.  I am not an audiophile but the sound is perfect for me.  I did not have any of the issues some report about having to insert and remove them because the sound was not set right for the VR headset.  For me they just worked out of the box.<br /><br />Comfort is not so great.  Usually my head hurts from the headband of the Quest long before anything else but these hurt my ears before the headband hurts my head.  I am not blaming the earbud company as they can not make their earbuds fit everyone's ears but for me they don't fit well at all.  I have gone through each of the 3 different sets of rubbers and picked the best out of the 3 but still they hurt after an hour of use.<br /><br />So sound quality gets 5 stars from me.  Comfort and fit gets a 3 1/2 but ill round up to 3 3/4 but since that brings the total to just under 4 1/2 I have to give them a 4 star rating.,positive,negative
B0100XI7ME,4.0,"Why the 4 stars you say? Well, frankly, I like volume with my music.  I really hoped with the Harmon Kardon signature sound that  the sound would be dynamic; it's just not. I'm not even a huge bass head, but I like to be allowed to have a decent amount and it just doesn't get loud enough. Also, the Tone Pros (the next model down) have true noise reduction; these do not. On both models however the sound on phone calls is the best I've ever experienced. I really like the retractable concept; I found with the LG Tone Ultras that the dangling of the earbuds got caught in things, and I like that I can wear the Infinium around my neck and retracted while waiting for the next call.",positive,positive

I drilled a 1/2&quot; hole through my hobby workbench (countertop) and used the included base to bolt it down. I have another one on the way. Now I have to find a place to store all the spare parts, just in case I want to mount it some other way. The only issue I had was one set of VESA mount screws was too long even with the spacers.

When I saw these at such a good price,  I decided to buy him a pair.  I wasn't expecting much, but the sound quality and battery life is as good as my airpods.  I really appreciate the case.  I think it will protect them, but also keep them from getting lost.  I also like that you can charge them directly from the case.

B07HBRTQD1,4.0,"I work in photo/video for a living, and I can tell you that good LEDs aren't cheap. I have worked with hot tungsten lamps for high output and smaller LEDs for lightweight smaller setups, but LED lights that can compete with the output of Tungstens are pricey.<br />That being said, this is a FANTASTIC light. It has high output yet has the pros of LED panels such as lower power consumption and heat, as well as being dimmable and color adjustable from the panel or remote control. I had the opportunity to use this for a job yesterday setting up an interview in an office setting. My tungsten bulbs would have been too bright and need gels to match the rest of the office. My other smaller LEDs would have cast smaller spots and we all know a larger light source casts a more pleasing glow. It seemed effortless to get the amount of light we needed in a short time.<br />HOWEVER, I did find that the mounting point was a little bit difficult to use. There are two bolts to secure it to the stand, and both need to be loosened to mount it properly. It took me a few attempts to get it on the stand, one side felt like I was screwing the bolt the wrong direction most of the time. Meanwhile, the light is large and kept wobbling during this overly complicated procedure. It didn't feel like a premium product during that, which I found odd considering the price point. I have lights that cost about half of this one that felt more premium during mounting. But, that being said, once the lights are up it works a treat!<br />So, a solid 4 stars from me. Almost 5 if the mounting were easier or the price lower to make up for that. But as a light, it does what it should do and well.",positive,negative

B07J2NZLZS,3.0,"I had high hopes for this little turntable.  It looked perfect for my oldest son who is a huge 80's music fan and thought he should hear it in its original format.  We were excited to unbox it and play the two albums we picked up at the used book store.  First impressions were OK.  The case looks nice and love the two speakers built in.  Opening it, we were underwhelmed by the plastic turntable, stylus arm and rather cheap looking controls.  But we were still excited.<br /><br />The sound was also a little disappointing.  The two speakers are underpowered and all high end so it was pretty tinny.  But the absolute worst was that they stylus is so head light that it skipped constantly.  We put a small glass bead on it and the weight actually slowed the turntable.  We backed off and placed a quarter on it and it played about right.  But again, I was underwhelmed by the underpowered turntable.  Also, we noted that one of the spongy pads on the turn table was not installed properly and put a list to the album.  We fixed that and fixed the quarter to the stylus and we were able to get it to play through Adam Ant's Friend or Foe album.  The scratchy quality of between songs brought me back 40 years to my own first phonograph, which I think was pretty crappy, but probably better than this one.<br /><br />It works, its nostalgic.  We have had fun and will probably get an album at every used bookstore, garage sale, or antique store we find them in, but we will need to upgrade if he goes beyond just enjoying the novelty of it.",positive,negative
B074WTKWG6,4.0,"If you're familiar with the brand then they live up to their same sound standard. I do wish the case was more rugged so that I felt more comfortable with how they would survive a drop, if that day ever comes. A feature which I detest is that the earbuds do NOT work independently of each other. The right one can be used without the left but the left CAN NOT be used separately. If the right earbud is in the case charging then the left earbud will not activate. This is one of the primary reasons why I chose to upgrade from my previous wired set and since I did not know that that would be an issue I did not look for that function in the description and reviews. In fact I still do not know what they would call this feature and in reading up on other wireless earbuds have not see it described or listed. I do also wish they were a little more snug/secure in my ear. Anytime I open my mouth, to eat for example, they become dislodged.",positive,negative

B0791TX5P5,2.0,"Not happy with my ""upgrade"" from a fire box. Streaming is generally fine once it is working, but, man, can it be slooooooooooow to load the home screen, respond to a button press, etc. Also, it sometimes randomly fails and provides zero feedback. For example, I recently adjusted my wifi access point to use a DFS frequency. The fire stick stopped connected to the wifi with ""unexpected error"". I tried a variety of things including ""forgetting"" the network, rebooting the stick, etc. Never did I get a useful error message. This thing is supposed to support a/n/ac, but it can't deal with a DFS frequency. No other device in my household had this problem. We've had other random issues here and there.<br /><br />Fwiw, I do provide the usb connection for power, but it complains about not having usb power. I don't get it.

B08NCF9K62,2.0,"The only thing that separates this tablet from others in this price range is that it boasts LTE connectivity.  Unfortunately, I do not have a sim to try with this tablet so I did not test it.  Beyond this functionality, everything about this tablet is pretty much sub-par.<br /><br />The screen resolution is barely HD.  1280x800 on a 10"" screen means that the pixels are quite big and can be distracting.  The audio quality is tinny and underpowered as one would expect and the cameras are nothing to write home about.  The size and weight is fairly standard.  It is about the thickness of an old cell phone such as an LG G5 and it is slightly heavier than a Samsung Tab A 10"".  I do need to say that the screen bezel isn't big.<br /><br />The OS, on the other hand is pure Android with no extra bloat and to add to the good news, Netflix does run on this tablet (Neflix updated their app a while ago to stop running on ""unknown"" android devices).  Most Android apps are expected to run on this tablet and for me, all apps that I wanted to use (comic book reader, plex, netflix, and youtube) run and I didn't feel any lag in using them.<br /><br />The Achille's Heel of this device is its wireless drivers (which covers WIFI and Bluetooth).

B09JG6R7NK,4.0,"This is a very cool digital art tool. It's a combination of wacom-style drawing surface and external monitor, so you can draw directly on the screen like paper instead of looking at the computer screen while you sketch.<br />Ideally, you can use a USB-C port on a device that supports it so that you can combine displayport and USB input device into one cable. However, it seems like you'd need an additional USB for power in many cases, and in my case I needed to use the three-wire solution: One HDMI out from the computer, one USB for the pen input signal, and the 3rd USB for power. Kind of a rats nest of wire and not very portable. It really makes me wish I had bought a Surface or Lenovo Yoga with the active Wacom pen built in so that I get this functionality in a much cleaner setup, but at least with this it is a pretty cool addition to my desktop without buying a separate computer. And now I can have something else on my PC screen while this operates as a drawing canvas screen #2. Cool for a desktop, not so much for a laptop, since there are 3 wires to connect at a minimum.<br />I've noticed that the driver is a little bit difficult to use sometimes- I've had to set up the drawing area in settings only to have it default when I reboot to the original drawing area and need to be set again. I'm still getting used to it. But when it works, it IS really cool. You need to find software that can support it properly, like Krita for example, if you want to get the full effect out of the pressure sensitive drawing. That being said, it feels kind of expensive and I wish it were a more straight forward and seamless experience for the money, but I don't think there's really a better way to do this with an existing PC.<br />If you want to add drawing capability to an existing computer instead of buying a Surface/Yoga/iPad Pro/etc, this is the way.",positive,positive

B008RW6QHY,4.0,"I have three main uses for tripods, food photography, nature photography and to hold up a spotting scope.  This tripod succeeds wonderfully at two of those.  It is great for nature photography and supporting the spotting scope.  I am 6' 3"" and I love that height of this tripod. even without extending the center post, I can comfortably use the tripod when standing.<br /><br />This is a fantastic birdwatching tripod for my spotting scope.  The carbon fiber material is light and rugid. Vanguard has remembered the little things, for example, the upper legs are padded which is huge in when trying to spot an owl in Minnesota at twenty below.  The insulation makes the tripod much more comfortable to handle, equally when shooting images of Northern lights.<br /><br />The legs are fairly sturdy although I feel that here is a little more play in the carbon fiber over my older aluminum, Bogen tripod. I was a little disappointed that there are just a few angle settings for the legs.  They click into 30 and about 60 degrees.  It would be nice to have more granular settings, so I find myself altering leg lengths more than my other tripod. The feet are well designed with hard steel spikes with nice rubber feet for indoor uses.  Both options allow for good stable footings.<br /><br />Also there are some great other details like leveling bubbles on the top of the tripod and ball head.  Also, I like that they though to include a hook at the bottom of the center post for adding stability weights.  The leg releases are easy to use and have held tight during all my time in the field with the tripod.<br /><br />Where I wish they had put more into this tripod is the ball head. It doesn't seem to live up to the tripod body.  I miss a pan handle and while I appreciate the feel and functionality of the locking knobs, it just seems like it is not the pro quality of the rest of the tripod.  There is a second leveling bubble on the head itself which is fantastic.  But probably the biggest drawback is the quick release plate.  It is not quick at all, it requires quite a bit of screwing with thumbscrew to attach.  Also there is not set screw on the ""quick"" release plate.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ Height<br />+ padded legs for comfort in cold weather<br />+ Light Weight<br />+ Great feet, both the grippy robber shoes and the steel spikes<br />+ built in leveling bubbles<br />+ Functional and strong leg locks<br />+ built in hook on bottom of center post<br />+ Second leveling bubble on the head<br /><br />Cons<br />- No built in strap<br />- Carrying case is ok (this is more a neutral than a con)<br />- the head is not great<br />- limited leg angles<br />- Head could be better<br />- Somewhat awkward and slow quick release plates<br />- Lacks a panning arm.<br /><br />In General, this is an awesome tripod, but for the money I would have expected a little more, especially a strap and a better head unit.  But I have to admit I love this tripod.  I would have put 4.5 stars if possible, but for $500 my expectation for a ""Professional"" tripod head is a little higher.  But for my uses it's awesome, it holds the Spotting Scope will but again, lack of a panning arm hinders it.  From the shoulders down, the best I've seen.",positive,positive
B01N53RO3X,5.0,"I'm going to swallow my pride and admit that it took me a REALLY long time to figure out how to get a good fit/seal with these headphones. Honestly, 30 minutes of fiddling with them, and I was ready to give up and send them back - they were uncomfortable and offered no better sound than my $10 pair of bud headphones. BUT...if you happen to have the same problem, hang in there! These headphones really are incredible!<br /><br />What I didn't realize at first was these come with one of the optional &#34;wing&#34; skins already on. I had been trying to put another pair of the wings on over it, and it was awful. But lo and behold, when I took the one skin off and put the correct wing size on...then figured out the right bud size for me...then figured out exactly how to twist them in, allow the wing to hook under the groove in my ear, and press slightly to get a good seal in my ear canal...WOW, these have amazing sound!<br /><br />They have been very easy to pair with any device, I love the charging dock, and I've been able to run them a long time before re-charging. I might be most impressed by the range, though. I do use these when working out, but more often I use them while doing housework, and I can go several rooms apart - putting laundry away, even going outside to dump the garbage - and the sound stays constant. And once I figured out the fit/seal in my ears, they have been comfortable to wear.",positive,positive
B00KQG6QFG,3.0,"I've had a number of Bluetooth headphones and the overwhelming majority of them have an ""audio interface"" that makes sense - some bare bones, some quite pleasant.  This interface is in the form of sounds the relate to each of the functions - power on/off, paring, etc.  These headphones have a TERRIBLE interface.  When you power them on an annoyingly loud series of tones blares in your ear.  The tones rise in pitch.  When you continue to hold the power button, to access the paring mode, all you hear is an extremely brief, muffled tone.  Apparently, the makers thought this was enough of a signal to indicate you're in paring mode.  Believe me, it is NOT obvious at all.  When you power off the headphones, you hear the same annoying loud series of tones.  In this case, the tones do not decrease in pitch, which one might expect.<br /><br />By comparison, the audio interface of my other Bluetooth headphones are a joy - unfortunately, they do not have volume controls or skip and rewind.  When powering them on, a pleasant female voice says, ""Hello"", and when you enter pairing mode, the same voice says, ""Ready to pair.""  When pairing is established, the voice says, You're connected"", then tells me how much charge I have - either full, medium or low.  These Cootree headphones do none of that.  You'll be lucky if you're able to tell if they've been turned off properly.<br /><br />In terms of sound quality, they're okay - nothing exceptional.  In terms of fit, they're okay as well.  Again, nothing exceptional.  To my knowledge, they do not have an active noise cancelling function, other than what little noise they may happen to muffle by covering your ears.  I mention this only because the rating form asks about it.",positive,negative
B0028Y4H1O,4.0,"I was looking for a simple sort of cd clock radio to keep on a nightstand.  It's amazing how difficult it was to find something like that that fit my needs, and I ended up with this unit although I really wasn't intrested in the iPhone/iPod connections.  I went to a local electronics store and first tried a litte Sony machine, was set to buy it, and then the salesman showed me this Phillips unit.  The sound was overwhelmingly better on the Phillips unit.  I admit I'm not an audiophile, but I just want something that sounds good when I played CDs at bedtime.  I quickly dismissed the little Sony and went for this unit.  Since having it about a week now, I really like the sound from the CD player.  I did try my iPhone 4 on it to see if it would connect, and it did and it played music like a champ.  Strong and clear.  I have a rubber bumper on my iPhone and had to remove it to make the phone fit properly but that's no big deal.  In fact what I'm thinking of doing is reprogramming my older iPhone (first generation) with nothing but music on it and leaving that plugged in the Phillips unit.  I keep my iPhone 4 in a different charger in a different room so it doesn't disrupt my sleep AND so I won't forget it when I'm leaving the house.  So far I'm a happy camper with this little Philips unit.  The only con is the brightness of the backlit display which is rather bright.  I placed the unit in a different part of the room where the remote still works but the brightness of the display doesn't affect my sleep.  I like a dark room!",positive,positive
B095K4BFBL,4.0,"This card's R/W numbers aren't amazing, but I didn't really expect them to be. For the price, the fact that you get 2x cards with 64gb is impressive! I'm not familiar with this brand and I'm not sure if I'd trust it with mission-critical storage (flying a drone for work, for example) especially if it requires high speed data to read and write, but for something like a media player or dashcam/security camera recording, this would be a great option to throw in.<br /><br />For now, I'm formatting one to use in a Raspberry Pi project and the other will probably go in my car's media player. Definitely a good deal for the storage space.",positive,positive
B00CKYVYI6,5.0,This is THE bluetooth speaker in which to compare all others. It is plenty loud for a battery operated speaker and VERY durable. The battery lasts between 5-6 hours on a decent volume and can operate while it is charging. I honestly cannot complain about this product at all. I got exactly what I was expecting and am very pleased.,positive,positive
B01K3WYKW8,4.0,"I use this to connect my MP3 player to a 3.5mm jack I installed in my car's center console. The low-profile 3.5mm connector was very important to me because I wanted to make the connection as slim as possible to avoid accidentally torquing it, catching things on it, or applying pressure to the jack when moving things in and out of the console.<br /><br />It works quite well for this purpose. the connector is slim - about as slim as they come, such that it basically clamps right up against the side of the player and the wall of the console. The plug itself feels solid and has a small snap when connecting to things. The cable is soft and almost as flexible as a woven cord, even if it does prefer some orientations to others. Sound quality is typical - which is to say, as good as every other cable I've owned.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about the cable was the colors - it really doesn't go with the car interior and stuck out as a result, a bit distracting. So I used a Sharpie Pro - the big chisel-tip type - to turn it black. It is cotton sheathing, so this is quite viable. I was careful - after inking the entire cable and letting it dry, I washed it in warm water, then dried it and ran a soft, clean rag over it about a hundred times, until it came away basically clean. After the fact, while you could tell the original black bits from the inked threads, it's just different shades of black, rather than looking blotchy. I imagine using something like RIT black dye would be about equally effective, if you heated it and let it soak for a good long while.<br /><br />So I would recommend it. The braided cable looks premium and is much easier to work with than its equally-thick rubber counterparts. This makes it easy to handle the MP3 player while it is still plugged in.",positive,positive
B009JPBPWO,5.0,I bought this keyboard for my Nexus 10 tablet.  It works great and connects quickly via bluetooth when turned on.  It comes with a case that keeps the keyboard protected and also acts as a stand for tablet.  The keys feel great on the fingers as well. So glad I bought this keyboard!,positive,positive
B075YGGKVX,4.0,works fine. Hope it can clamp thicker monitor.,positive,positive
B0B8VKJ94B,3.0,"This came on time and was well packaged. Initial impressions weren’t that great. Poor quality with all materials used.<br /><br />Pros: Three record playing speeds. Has RCA outputs to hookup to better speakers.<br /><br />Cons: Sound quality isn’t that great with the built in speakers. They sound cheap. The aesthetic of the case could have been put together better, maybe with higher quality materials. Did not come with a Needle.<br /><br />Overall this could have been a quality item had they took a little more care in building them.",positive,negative
B09D9XXHZL,5.0,"These little speakers are a bit heavy because of the wood so they won't topple over like light speakers. The sound quality is phenomenal, VERY good sound. Plenty of bass and boom from them too! I have them hooked up to my jukebox and they truly upgraded my listening experience! The remote and Bluetooth functions all work perfectly!<br /><br />Overall these are fantastic speakers and for the price point, I'm pretty surprised!! Didn't expect to love them this much!",positive,positive
B01DM7AEY4,5.0,"These are good walkie-talkies. I like the flexibility as far as power. We use the rechargeable batteries to save money, but you can use AA also. I also like that because when my son goes camping, he can bring extra batteries so it lasts longer. It has a lot of weather information, which is good, especially when camping.<br /><br />These were easy to use. They are compatible with other FRS/GMRS radios, which is great for us. We have a variety of these radios and a big family. I thought they worked pretty well. They were clear and had fairly good range. I really like the micro-USB charging option too. These are good for adults and for kids. They were pretty easy to use. I would recommend them.",positive,positive
B00JL4HN8I,5.0,"The primary lens I have on my camera is a good 18mm-55mm lens and it does great for capturing images that are a foot or more away. When I get much closer than that my camera is unable to focus properly and I end up with a crummy shot and I either have to give up or back up so that it can focus – not what I want most of the time. These magnifying lenses are a good solution, but there are somethings you have to keep in mind when using them.<br /><br />I will start with a statement that should be obvious: make sure you have the correct lens size when you are purchasing add-on lenses like this set. This particular set can be used only with a lens where the thread size is 55mm. If you have a lens that has a different sized thread, you should consider looking for this kit in a different thread size. You can use a ring adapter, but getting the right size at the start is better.<br /><br />There are four lenses in this kit, a 1x, 2x, 4x and 10x lens, each increasing in power as the numbers suggest. You can somewhat view these as magnifying glasses for your camera, but that metaphor is not completely accurate. They do magnify the image for you, but they allow a closer shot as well and you can get very close to your subject when you have one of these attached to your lens. Perhaps a better way to describe them is to realize that they make your camera very nearsighted and your camera can see close-up well and distance not at all when using these lenses.<br /><br />The main thing to remember about them is that as they go up the scale in strength they introduce a lot more edge distortion. This is most obvious with the 10x lens. If you take this lens and hold it so that you can see things through it clearly in the center, you cannot help but notice a large area around the edge of the lens that is distorted. The effect is less then you get it close to something on which you wish to focus but it is something to keep in mind. If there is too much distortion, use a less powerful magnification lens.<br /><br />These particular lenses have a little bit of heft to them but they are not what I would consider heavy. Because they are glass they are a bit more substantial than resin or plastic lenses.<br /><br />Overall, these are nice lenses. I have been able to use them for taking very close shots that I otherwise would not be able to take with my camera, such as ridge detail on a penny or dot patterns on magazine print. These are not real-world examples but they definitely show off the capabilities of such lenses. If you are looking for good magnification lenses for your camera, this is a good set that works well. Just make sure you have the right thread size before you buy.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.
