B00004T8R2,7,4.285714285714286,1,6,"The 1/8&#34; jack has stopped making a good connection with my iPad's female jack so the headphones are virtually worthless now. Great price to value ratio. These are my go-to cheap over the ear headphones.  For those of us who cannot use your buds, this is a solid choice. This is the best earphone for audio books. Been ordering it for years. nice headphones worth buying Great sound, very comfortable, durable cord.  Unlike most headphones I've dealt with recently, this cord actually holds up really well! The one downside is that the size adjustment portion on the band is pretty weak. Mine broke, so I'm buying a new pair. Honestly, great deal for the price. I still use them with the size adjuster bit broken. I've previously paid a lot more for headphones that were no better than these.  I use them on my computer and my MP3 player while in my home only because I hate when sound leaks from my headphones in public and people can hear what I'm listening to, however, for around the house these headphones are great. These handy little headphones are a fine buy at the price.  The sound quality is good, and they are comfortable on my ears.  I wear glasses, and some headphones don't work well over the frames. This set fits comfortably.  I use them every day, mostly to listen to the radio and they are holding up well.  And, my family doesn't have to listen to my choice in music and news...........",0.14285714285714285,3

All of the good reviews are right on. These are NOT $300 headphones but they have decent noise-cancelling properties for the price.  In addition, they stay on my ears when I'm exercising which is always nice.  My only complaint is that the headphones themselves are just a hair too big for my head, so even adjusted to the smallest size/length, they could still be a bit shorter.  But because of the way they're built, they still stay stable on my head. I'm pleased with this purchase. I didn't have to spend a lot of my money to get something that works.",0.0,3

B000092TT0,3,5.0,0,3,"Needed a Living Room sub for our 5.1 system. had to be somewhat small but pack a good punch.<br />Harman Kardon AVR1700 receiver, Axiom Audio M2 bookshelf and BIC center channel and couple of small polk audio rears.<br />once i went online read about a good starting point on this sub, it made my H/K auto setup so much easier. 80 is my crossover start and setup using H/K's LFE sub output. good match.<br />we get good deep sound (*way better than the cheaper sub we had earlier), it is pretty harmonious with our Axiom and BIC fronts.<br />still need to do a bit more tweaking as we run more blu ray movies. time for Matrix to be played. have only owned this for one week. so far can't be happier. This is pretty heavy, but not so large that it's hard to position. I have it next to my computer that I use to listen to Amazon streaming MP3 music. My main speakers are NHT Model Twos, and this subwoofer supplies an excellent bottom end to the music. I haven't played it loud yet, but I'm looking forward to trying it out on a movie soundtrack.<br /><br />The power switch has three positions -- Off, On, and Auto. In the Auto setting, it turns itself on if it senses an incoming signal. When I'm playing music softly, I'm finding that it takes a while to discover that it should turn on. In my case, the subwoofer is sitting next to my desk, and it's not hard to reach the power switch. But keep this in mind if you want to hide it somewhere that would make the power switch hard to reach. (It's near the top of the rear of the cabinet.) There's also a phase switch, with two positions. There's no magic to that; just set it to the position that sounds best. As with all subwoofers, the placement in your room isn't critical, although the subwoofer's sound can be somewhat amplified if you locate it in a corner.<br /><br />Update: I've had time now to use this with lots of different types of music, as well as TV and movies. The bass is very solid and tight, with no boominess at all. It blends beautifully, with plenty of power for my medium-sized room. This is very musical, adding firm support that's more than just ""punch"". This is surely one of the best values in powered subwoofers, and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat. It is hard to find a better subwoofer under $200",0.0,2
B0001FTVEK,6,3.1666666666666665,3,3,"Overall I am quite happy with this product. I believe the quality is good for the price and hope to use the headphones for quite a long time. The only hitch I had was with the connection. The instructions are fairly clear but I had to do some experimentation to get everything to work with my television.  One thing of note which might help ATT Uverse customers -- plug the red and white RCA connectors to the actual Uverse box (at the rear -- Audio Out) rather than to your television. I think this may have been mentioned by another reviewer but I had overlooked it earlier. Plugging into the unit eliminates the static also.  One last thing -- I would advise buyers of this product to purchase extra pads for the headphones. Once a style is no longer universally available the replacement pads can be very hard to find. For the $16 it is worth the money and saves grief later on. These are fabulous!  A friend told me about them. You can hear everything in these headphones while watching TV- birds, footsteps and all things you don't normally hear on a TV show.  Especially good for understanding English speaking PBS shows.  Great thing about these is that one person can have them on while watching TV , the sound on the TV can be muted so the other person sleeping doesn't hear the TV.  I would highly recommend them.  Just plug in and they work. Easy! After 6.5 months the charging dock stopped  recharging the headphones batteries.<br />I am not sure how the 2-year limited warranty works. As I try to start all my reviews with where it's made, this one falls into the Made in China category. It's not an extremely expensive hi-fi unit, eben thou it says it is hi-fi, but for the price the sound quality should a lot better. It's like listening to an am radio station that goes in and out of range. The tuning is not a simple selector switch, but instead it uses a scroll wheel located right by the volume scroll wheel. I'm not sure what genius thought that was a smart location for it, because on a few a occasions I've changed the tuning by mistake. if your TV is like mine with an aux cord out, and no sound system, than you might run into the issue where the TV won't play through its own speakers when the unit is plugged in and your using it. This may be an issue if you wanted to use it as a audio booster if you are hard of hearing and want a separate volume control from that of the TV's speakers. Overall it was just poor experience with the unit. I usually love Sennheiser products, and they used to be made very well, I believe there high end is still that way. but like every company these days they sacrifice a lot trying to cheapen themselves to a price point that everyone can afford. I was very conflicted before buying these headphones as I read the negatives and questioned whether these were as good as the last Sennheiser headphones that just broke. I will say that these perform differently when not charged fully. It is best not to use them before you've left them overnight on the charger. Then you will have less problems with static. You may hear static when you first put them on but as soon as the music or youtube video has started the sound is crystalline. I'm currently listening to some of my favorite music and it could not sound better. So I'm glad I took the chance even when I expected there to be issues. Sennheiser is really as good as AKGs once tuned in. You can also walk around the house with these on and take your music with you. Just charge them before using for the best results.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review I have owned many wireless headsets over the years due to long time hearing loss. This is the most expensive of the the lot and I had hoped these would be a better choice. Unfortunately the frequency seems to drift and you are constantly trying to adjust it back to get the volume back. The adjustment wheel is very sensitive and a pain to operate.  If the audio stops the unit times out and goes to white noise. I have used ref and infrared units some costing twenty dollars and NONE of them had these problems. Don’t ever try and tell me you get what you pay for. Life is not that simple.",0.5,2
B000R9AAJA,5,4.2,1,4,"I put a computer in the garage. I needed speakers that were cheap because of their limited (anticipated) use. These are very good, especially for the price. Let's face it, for the money you're not going to get true audiophile quality sound, but...<br /><br />I have all my music digitized and stored on a NAS. I was just looking for a cost effective (i.e. cheap) way to listen to my music in my bedroom where I have a laptop connected. These are small, very well constructed, nice looking, and nice sounding little speakers. I rated these 4 stars for sound quality considering the price. Just what I was looking for, very happy with them. These should only be purchased if you need portable speakers for a laptop or tablet. The sound is mediocre at best. They are light weight and portable.<br /><br />If you are looking for an affordable desktop speaker i recommend Creative A250 (about $30) These are great inexpensive speakers.  I needed some speakers for my desktop at work and these are great for that.  I haven't turned them up a lot since I can't be jamming out at work.  But for the price, they are well worth it. Small, compact, easy simple setup. Quality speakers with BIG sound. Expect nothing less from Logitech.",0.2,2
B000UXZQ42,5,3.6,1,4,"They bought these for us at work. They work so well, thar I bought a pair for home when I telework. They dramatically improve the ability to hear in meetings when using zoom or another software.  I would definitely recommend these headphones for both professional and private use. I am very happy with the sound and overall fit.  However,  the headphones start to hurt on long calls when wearing glasses.  Overall it is s great product. I bought these headphones because I thought they would last me a long time and the reviews were great.<br />The first pair I got at Walmart and those lasted me 2 years and then they stopped working and the latest one I bought on Amazon and thet just lasted me 1 year. I am so disappointed with these. I won't be buying them again. This really works well for Teams calls. The microphone and the noise cancelling in MS Teams seem to work very well, where I have been able to attend meetings and am heard very clearly without too much background noise. Felt like cheap plastic. Came with no original box just a plastic bag, I don’t know if maybe just Logitech sold it in bulk to the seller this way as it was easier for shipping and all for them. However, made me somewhat suspicious it could be a fake as it felt very cheap and other reviewers mentioned the same thing. I tried using the mute button on a face time call with my computer and after I clicked it the audio was lost completely, I tried messing with the audio settings on my computer and not even that would fix it. No other headphones I have ever used have done this and I have used headsets to work on a computer for 10 years. The sides of the headphones just said logi on them. I returned this!",0.2,3
B000ZH98LU,4,3.75,1,3,"I needed speakers for my computer.  Theses are inexpensive but have a very good sound.  I like that they don't need batteries and use a USB slot on the back of my computer.  They are only about 6.4 inch tall so they don't take up much room on my desk. THESE SPESKERS ARE OK.  THEY SOUND OK.  THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THEM IS THAT THE VOLUME CONTROL ARE PUSH BUTTON RATHER THAN DIAL BUTTON. AND YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE SPEAKER IN ORDER TO ADJUST THE VOLUME.  THEY WERE EASY TO CONNECT.  JUST PLUG IN THE USB CABLE. So I ordered these because my laptops music jack was broken.  These plug into your USB port and they worked perfectly for me.  Granted they are not powered so the volume only goes so high...  They aren't loud but they were perfect for my use.  If your looking for loud gaming sound or music you should look for a amplified set of speakers. Returned these speakers because they didn't produce sound loud enough in order to hear anything from my Macbook Pro computer. The sound they projected had a tinny quality that only made the background noises heard and not the speaking voices. I was disappointed because I have always purchased cheap speakers before, but I upgraded finally to ELEGIANT USB Powered Sound Bar Speakers after these failed me and I was not disappointed. The sound bar was three times more expensive, but the sound it produced cannot be beat. I get surround sound quality from my computer and the sound bar is much more compact and sleek than two clunky speakers. In my opinion, the sound bar cannot be beat!",0.25,2
B00140DBRY,3,4.333333333333333,0,3,"I've had this model for several years, and I lost it 2 weeks ago.  I a world of personal music (MP3) I find this small radio is still my favorite source. If for nothing else instant information.  I has great sound long battery life and you can plug in external speakers.<br />This little radio  (and a couple of AAA batteries) is what got me through 2 weeks of no power during Hurricane Sandy. Worth the investment. I primarily wanted a small radio to listen to AM at night and this one turned out to be a challenge because there's no backlight on the<br />Tuning dial. It's impossible to read the dial.

With off brand headphones, not so good.<br />This radio is probably OK if you're using it when it's light but not in the dark.<br />Print on keys wears off quickly, less than 1 year use. I bought one of these from another company for around $25.00.I was hesitant at first because it's a lot of money for a radio that you can only use with a headphone or ear buds but i took a gamble knowing it's a brand name and i figured that if i don't like it, i can always return it.Damn...this radio sounded great & i didn't know at first but it has a stereo sound and not like one of those radios that sounded tinny w/ a lot of echos (G.E.Radios are notorious for this!) I decided to keep it and the channels lock-on in the push of a button if you set your favorite channels.I never regretted buying this and after 6 years of daily use and dropped it numerous times, it's durability still amazes me and the thing just works EVERY TIME! you cannot buy anything better than this radio for the price in my opinion...if you do please let me know but it has to be $25.00 & lower.Good luck if you can find something like a Grundig radio for this price(they usually starts @ $60.00 & above)...",0.0,1
B0029Z9UNW,4,3.25,1,3,"I was looking to replace/upgrade my multimedia speakers without breaking the bank. These speakers fit my price range. I was iffy on buying these because I had never heard of the brand before, but the reviews were pretty positive, so I gave them a shot. Boy, am I glad that I did. They arrived in wonderful condition, as Amazon.com never disappoints when shipping anything. They hook up a bit differently than basic multimedia speakers,  but I had no trouble hooking them up. The sound out of these little powerhouses is fantastic. We're listening to Thelonious Monk, and it feels as if we're sitting right at one of his jazz shows way back when. It sounds good with any genre of music. The customizable bass and treble settings, make things nice. You're not put over the top with crazy controls, either. Operation is pretty straightforward. Anyone with a basic knowledge of technology, shouldn't have any problem using these speakers.  The only thing that I didn't like is that the remote gave out after only one use. We can't seem to get it to work now. That's the only reason I'm knocking them a star. If you want good bang for your buck, look no further. You won't be disappointed. Volume control feature is not very sophisticated. Bass delivery is on side of box - seems directionally challenged. Easy to set up. Stupid short plugs and wires... So cheap! System arrived quickly and suits my needs. Maybe I should have gotten a Bluetooth system. This is plugged into my TV My last review was a generous one, only because I didn't allow much time to pass before I did my first review. Things have changed. I have purchased four sets of these speaker systems. The very first set I bought for myself, last Christmas and over a year ago died. Amplifier electronics went bad, I think. This was way after the warranty expired but less than one year. I bought one set each prior to any malfunction, for both of my young adults, and another one for myself. The set I bought three weeks ago was dead when it arrived and the only music it made was a very loud buzzing right out of the box. So, I have two speaker set's that don't work and I will pass judgment after I talk with the manufacturer (Eagle) tomorrow. My big worry now is if the speaker sets' I bought my kids will die in short order. All in all, I am not pleased with the longevity of performances of the Eagle Orion. I purchased a set of Eagle Tech sound stage speakers prior to buying the Orion's and, the Eagle tech 140 watt version still sound great. So, I'm going straight to the manufacturer and see if they will do right by me. I will post what the resolution is, good or bad. This whole debacle is really a shame because they are great looking and sounding speakers and I think more often than not, this sort of thing happens for the speed of sales therefore decreasing quality control and inadequate testing prior to shipping. Two out of four in less than one year or 3 weeks means something isn't right with the process. Speaker system arrived today and was straight forward hook up to my 32&#34; flat screen. I give three stars<br /><br />1 star for quality of sound this little system really boosted the sound of my TV in my living room. You can adjust the base. treble and volume individually to you're listening needs as my living room is 15x18 feet and fills the room with good sound and comes with a remote<br /><br />1 star for simplicity of hookup to any device i want<br /><br />1 star for the durability of the system itself and looks great for the price.<br /><br />I took away two stars for GOOD reasons<br /><br />The remote is very cheep junk i do not expect to last for more than a few weeks. if you stack four quarters up that's how thick the remote is and it bends easily I am going to try to program a universal remote to this tomorrow<br /><br />The second star is removed because the buttons on the front are poor quality the first time i touched the volume button it got stuck in and had to gently tap it several times for it to pop back out , I expect the buttons to not last if used every day so again i will try to set up a universal remote for volume control<br /><br />Over all good sounding system remote needs improvement along with buttons on front",0.25,2

Took about ten minutes to unpack and position the speakers to my liking. I plugged the 3.5 mic jack into my TV. Did have to wiggle it a bit to get a good connection. Turned the speaker volume up and adjusted the bass response on the subwoofer to my liking. I learned that the sound becomes clearer and louder when the bass is turned down instead of up. Everything sounds very good to my ears and I can easily adjust the volume with the TV's remote. I will be ordering a second set of these speakers for use with my iMac. Great speakers, great sound.

B002HWRZ2K,5,2.2,3,2,"It's fine for some one who doesn't like to thump...  The sub puts out little bass and speaker are for highs only..  Local pawn shop gave me 15 bucks after the kids poured yogart in the sub port Pros = cheap, easy to set up, headphone jack and volume button.<br />Cons = The thing that has the volume button on it is cheap piece of crap.<br />It must have been damaged somehow, I have to press the button in a certain way or else I will only hear sound out of one of the channels. Nothing's wrong with the speakers, so the whole thing is broken because of this button. I bought the combo with the Bluetooth adapter.<br />The bt has a nice wide range and fast connection time.<br />The speakers are loud and the base is well balanced for the satellites.<br />The ability to turn them on and off along with the volume control is very handy. These are a nice addition to my shop. I ordered this speaker set online as a replacement for an old Logitech set that I had and I really miss my old one. :( The sound on this one is just okay, but sadly there are no knobs on it to control the bass and the trebel separately so you cannot get great sound or bass for parties etc like I could with my last model. It also means you're stuck with bass if your roommates want to sleep which has cut down my music listening time quite a bit. The remote control is handy but only has on/off and volume features which is disappointing because I thought the ability to change bass and trebel would be there as well. Last but not least, I hate the way the remote is attached to the speakers. It has a Y shaped cord so it constantly gets wrapped up in my mouse cord or power cord to my lap top. It is a fairly inflexible cord so it is constantly in the way. The sound is quality and I like Logitech speakers but I would definitely recommend ordering the version with the ability to control the subwoofer independently. Package arrived as expected.  Speakers are great but the woofer emits a low humming noise as soon as it was plugged in and noise continues throughout usage.",0.6,0
B003CP0OT2,4,5.0,0,4,"These are small but very clear. Easy to replace my 7 year old JBL computer speakers. Same simple plugs. Logitech, THANK YOU for this great product! Having always had poor speakers for my PC -- until now -- I never realized what great sound could be delivered! All I can say is Wow! I am very impressed by the facts that these speakers are inexpensive, but clearly well-made, and the sound is pure and powerful. Two thumbs up! For the price of the speaker these work well. They are made in china as expected, but still feel well made. These are simple only three wires power, 3.5mm , and the wire joining the two speakers. They are simple to operate with only a volume level control, and are great for the YouTube watcher or some moderate level music. You won't get the same bass out of these as you would with a 2.1 channel sound system, but that is expected. I like Logitech speakers because in my experience they tend to stand behind their product. I had another set of speakers from them that went bad, and after a few questions they sent me a new unit without requiring an RMA for the old ones. Overall if you need a set of basic speakers these are great and reasonably priced. These are great speakers, smaller than the logitech they replaced, and have just as much volume if not more.",0.0,2
B003EM2WAW,3,5.0,0,3,"At this great price, I always keep a couple of extra sets in my purse for when my kids lose or break their earbuds. The sound is quite good.

These are perfect inexpensive earbuds for everyday use. Fun colors too! New favorite headphones!  Absolutely love them.. fit in ears great. Best headphones I've bought in the last year. No more searching!",0.0,3
B003EM8008,9,4.222222222222222,1,8,"Great value for the money.  The buds go right up behind your tragus really blocking any extra sound.  For those of us with a tragus piercing, it does work fine, but my earring starts to ache after maybe 45 minutes.  But it does not slip out even with the tragus stud.  The wire seemed like poorer quality than I was anticipating--thicker and flat rather than thin and roundish like the more current models--but that is more of a style critique than one of functionality.  The headphones have worked well for the few weeks that I have been using it.  If you're looking for something that will stay in your ear and block out all other sound, producing high sound quality, this is a great model to get, especially for the price. Only reason I wouldn't give these 5 stars is the input end?(not sure what it's called) The input portion that you would put into the phone is &#34;L&#34; shaped versus &#34;l&#34;. I have to buy a new phone case so that I can use the headphones with the case on. Other than that, these headphones are fantastic! Crystal clear sound with minimal volume, and I don't even mind that they are in-ear. They are headphones that perform very poorly with regards to other headphones I have purchased from Amazon. These earbuds have great sound, they fit in my ear comfortably and don't come out unless I want them to.  Great value for the price I paid.  I have paid over twice as much for similar earbuds and these sound way better. Good headphones for what I need them for, which is the gym. Reasonably priced too. Let me start off by saying that I have used many, many different earbuds and headphones over the years, and these are by FAR the best bang for my buck in terms of quality, durability, and comfort. I've always managed to land jobs where I'm able to listen to audio content throughout my workday, and have consequently spent most of my working hours with at least one earbud tucked into my ears.<br /><br />I thread these down to my pocket where they are plugged into my iPod full time. No matter how much running, walking, lifting, jumping or moving around I do (and I work as a package delivery guy, which means hundreds of movements and ten miles of walking a day), these things take ages to wear out. Under normal use, I'm sure they'd never need replacing unless you managed to blow out the speaker somehow, or cause blatant damage to them. They don't cut in and out from wear on the jack end or on the headphone ends like some other earbuds, which will give way after being cranked around a bit.<br /><br />Next, I have to address the comfort of the ergonomically shaped buds themselves. They are formed to fit into ear, with the speaker being offset from the center of the housing. On others, such as the classic white Apple earbuds, the round shape causes me some discomfort and soreness after hours of wear. But these are just fantastic. I wear them for up to 11 hours at a time with no discomfort whatsoever.<br /><br />Finally, the sound quality. While an audiophile purist will say that they probably don't meet the highest standards in the land, they do a pretty good job. They stand up to much more expensive earbuds, and if you use the proper sized adapter for your ear (three sizes included), the speaker isolates sound very well, so you don't even need any noise-canceling feature. I wear them while driving a diesel truck with the doors open driving down the freeway, and I can hear every word of the audiobook I'm listening to. The treble is good. The bass is excellent for such an inexpensive earbud. And the overall sound quality is going to put other in-ear buds to shame.<br /><br />For less than ten bucks, there is no better ear bud out there. I've owned three pairs over the last two years, and I would only have needed one if I didn't abuse them so much with daily use and extreme wear. If you want to try these, but would like to keep a microphone feature for hands-free calls, you can get some identical to these with in-line microphone in the Panasonic RPTCM125K model. I got these are my on the gone headphones. They work great Good headphones for my tween son. He likes them. Says they fit well and are comfortable to wear. Now if he can just keep up with them! These earbuds last for pretty long. I am pretty impressed. I think the price is reasonable for the quality",0.1111111111111111,3
B003NR57BY,3,4.333333333333333,0,3,"Not much you can say about a mouse except that it works as it's expected.  This one feels good in the hand and has a scroll wheel and forward and back buttons, and the battery life is phenomenal.  It will run forever on a couple AA batteries.  I have three of these now.  Also, the wireless receiver is small enough it doesn't protrude from the computer or laptop far enough to get bumped off or broken accidentally. I work full-time from home and have been using this same Logitech mouse for years. When it’s time for a replacement, I do look to see what other options are out there…but I just keep coming back to this one.<br /><br />It’s comfortable in my hand and responds well to my touch. The only reason I need to replace it is because I often eat at my desk and sometimes that’s hard on a mouse. Also, when you consider how much time we spend using a mouse, the surface is just bound to wear down.<br /><br />I like the size…I have tried the mini versions but that size isn’t practical for me working all day at a computer.<br /><br />I probably don’t use all the features…just the wheel and left/right clicks. It rolls nicely and the battery life lasts quite a while. I like the little green light on the top to tell me it still has a charge.<br /><br />I use a basic mouse pad with a built-in wrist rest and my hand and arm do not feel any strain. The rubberized grip really helps me hold onto it comfortably.<br /><br />I have seen this mouse in other patterns but I stick with this dark gray version. I have a black desk and I would just prefer to keep everything monochromatic, since my office is in my home.<br /><br />Definitely plug and play once you put in the USB receiver.<br /><br />I think this is a quality item for the price and I will continue to purchase, as needed. I highly recommend its reliability. It's comfortable for my medium sized lady hands (I can rest my hand on the mouse) and I love the features (scroll wheel, forward and back buttons), but like others have said the scrolling is choppy. You have to really focus it to get it on an window close button for example. That said, it's my best choice for a Logitech unifying receiver mouse. The M325 worked very well but was too small for my hand.<br /><br />I just wish it worked as well as my Logitech MediaPlay mouse I bought a decade ago. Unfortunately that has a giant USB receiver and I work on a Macbook with only two USB ports and also use a wireless keyboard.<br /><br />Ugh, no perfect solution for me.",0.0,1
B003VAK1I2,3,5.0,0,3,"Got this speaker (Logitech USB Laptop Speaker Z305) for my Mac to amp up the sound during movies ... and just love it.  It attaches super easily, has great sound, easy-access on/off, and volume controls on the speaker which are readily accessible while it's on the pc.  Highly recommend.  Please note that I purchased this in 2011 when the price was $39.99 (just noticed Dec 29, 2012 price is now over $100!) I bought these speakers a few years ago for a laptop I had that only had 1 little speaker built into it and this speaker has worked great even now as I have them hooked up to the store laptop were I work. I only paid $45 brand new from an online source ( not sure now who it was it was so long ago ) but I can say that they still look like I just bought them and pulled them from the package. I don't understand how these can be listed and sold for $289.99 when they are only worth at best $45 which even when I bought them for $45 I thought they were a tad bit overpriced then but for the extreme price I found them for now is just a total rip off cause even though they sound pretty good for a little speaker set they are no where near worth $289.99. For that price I would buy an entire 6.1 surround system and hook my laptop to it, OH! I already did that for $150 and I still use these and only paid $45 when I bought them a few years ago. My laptop built-in speakers are totally inadequate, so based on customer reviews for this speaker, I purchased it for my computer.  ""Easy"" to install is just that - even I could do it! Clip the speaker to the top of the screen, plug the USB into a port on your computer, and listen!  Speaker quality is terrific, a great range for loudness, and the sound is extremely clear.  It was a great buy!",0.0,2
B003VANOFY,3,2.3333333333333335,2,1,"I have had this pair of headphones for over 2 years now with very minimal problems. Sometimes it will stop working, especially if our Roku is on in the other room. Recently the material covering the styrofoam ear pads wore off and the microphone somehow snapped in half so I am ordering another pair. When i first got these i was living out in the woods in a very rural area and i gave them 5 stars. The sound quality of both the headphones and Mic are beautiful, the surround sound is mind-blowing, and i loved being able to walk around my house listening to stuff without bothering my family.<br /><br />I have moved into an apartment complex recently and these are now a useless decoration. whenever I try to use them there is so much interference that it causes the connection to the wireless usb to cut out all the time, to the point they are unusable. it comes with a nice long cord to charge it, but even plugged in it only sends data wirelessly, so they are fully powered and unable to maintain a connection.<br /><br />amazing headset, but with this crippling flaw they are useless in dense population areas. MY HISTORY WITH THIS PRODUCT:<br />I've owned this headset for almost a full year. Technically, I've had two of them, since the boom mic snapped off the first one and had it replaced. I use these every day, for multiple hours and a variety of uses (VoIP calls, gaming, music, and movies).<br /><br />PROS:<br />The audio quality, when it is working, is good. The bass in 7.1 mode is great, and the overall surround sound is pretty convincing. They are comfortable and rechargeable via USB.<br /><br />CONS:<br />The biggest problem here is the wireless connection. Both headsets I owned suffered from this same problem - they would frequently just restart or lose the signal and reconnect. The process takes about 3-5 seconds each time, and sometimes you get multiple restarts in a row. It doesn't sound too bad until it happens when you're watching a movie and you have to quickly pause or rewind a bit because you suddenly couldn't hear anything they were saying (which also completely pulls you out of the movie), or when it drops out in the middle of a phone conversation, or drops out at the worst possible moment in a game... It happens probably two dozen times a day, if not more. At first, I didn't care too much about it, but the first time you have it drop out 3 times in a matter of a single minute, it's simply maddening. Imagine going randomly deaf for several seconds throughout every day of your life, and you'll get a sense of what it's like.<br /><br />If I could simply plug the cable in and it would use the USB cable to transmit the audio instead of wireless, that would be perfect, but when it's plugged in, it simply charges the internal battery - you still get audio interruptions all the time. The interruptions will also reset the ""mute"" status on the mic, which can be troublesome if you're intentionally muted on a conference call and suddenly your mic is on and people hear you eating lunch.<br /><br />Second problem is that the power button is a bit flaky. If the headset is plugged in via USB and powered off, sometimes it will not power on unless you unplug the headset and THEN power it on (and then you can plug it back in to continue charging). I thought it was a defect in my first headset until the same thing happened with the second one.<br /><br />A minor third problem is that the boom mic is a little flimsy on the construction. I am careful with my toys, but it still cracked and finally snapped off one day when I was lowering the mic to use it, and that was only a few months into owning it.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />If they would fix the wireless, I would rate this 4 stars in a heartbeat. If they fixed the power button, it would go up to 5. That said, the G35 seems to be the G930 but wired, and cheaper. The number of times that I've wanted to really make good use of the wireless (go to another room and keep the audio going) is far less frequent than the dozens upon dozens of times that the audio cuts out, so it's just an unacceptable point for me, since that is what this headset is about.",0.6666666666666666,3
B004K09H32,3,4.0,0,3,"This is a combined review of two of the lowest cost “Active Noise Cancelling” earbuds on Amazon:<br />[[ASIN:B004K09H32 Audio-Technica ATH-ANC23 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling In-Ear Headphones]]<br />[[ASIN:B00SA5JCWO Egghead 1010 - Active Noise Cancelling Earbuds with Travel Pouch]]<br /><br />PRICE<br />The price difference as of May, 2015 was $14 with Audio-Technica being the more expensive unit.<br /><br />IN THE BOX<br />Both products contain:<br />--Earbuds<br />--Multiple silicone earbud cups<br />--Airline headset adapter<br />--Carrying Pouch<br /><br />Audio-Technica contains in addition:<br />--Battery<br />--Pair of foam earbud cups.  Not memory foam, just normal foam.  I have not tried these.<br /><br />Egghead:<br />--Mute button:  In addition to the ANC on/off switch, Egghead has a nice mute button that turns off Noise Cancellation while it is pressed down.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY<br />I am not an audiophile so the sound from both headsets were good to me but the difference comes when you factor in the fit of the earbuds.<br /><br />FIT<br />Both sets sit deeply in your ear and from pictures of both products, you will see that beyond the earbud, they have a circular piece before the actual connection to the wires.<br />--Egghead:  The earbuds are attached straight to the circular piece so the fit is actually straight out away from your ears.<br />--Audio-Technica:  The earbuds are angled forward so the circular piece actually serves as an anchor that sits nicely in your ear lobe and further cuts out outside noise.  The additional foam earbud cup may make the difference for some people when it comes to a comfortable fit.<br />--Kids:  I purchased these for a trip that the family will take.  The kids usually have a hard time with normal earbuds not fitting in very well but they were able to keep the Audio-Technica earbuds in using the smallest earbud cups.  The kids are 6 and 9.<br /><br />NOISE REDUCTION<br />Here is the main event.  I want to make a few points about Active Noise Cancelling:  --Noise cancellation filters are designed to cancel out lower pitched, repeating noises like airplane engine rotors and car tires on a road, but it will not cancel out high or mid-range sounds like human voice.  The same engine rotor and road noise also contain components of higher pitched sounds so NC filters will not cut out the noise completely.<br />--Using Noise Cancellation often feels like being underwater with your ears popping.  It is a discomfort that you would have to get used to.  The greater the cancellation effect, the greater the discomfort.  Be prepared for this if you haven’t used NC before.<br />--ANC only works IF the inverted noise wave can overpower the noise coming in.  If you are using a lawn mower and the noise it makes overpowers the “anti noise” because you’re standing right in back of the motor, you will not hear a big difference in the Noise Reduction effects.<br /><br />Ok, so on with it.  The Audio-Technica claims to reduce 90% of noise.  I don’t have anything to confirm the claim but if we assume the Audio-Technica(AT) to be at 90%, my own assessment of the Egghead’s (Egg) noise reduction effects would be around 50-60%.<br /><br />--Computer Fan Noise:  Egg reduces the noise to slightly audible but you’d need to use toggle the mute button on it to really tell.  AT completely removes the noise.<br />--Clothes Dryer:  Egg takes the “edge” off the noise produced.  You can still hear most of the noise standing about 3 feet away from the dryer.  AT takes the bass tones completely out of the noise while leaving the higher pitched metal friction and buttons hitting the tumbler noise.  In effect, with the AT, standing only 3 feet away, it sounds like you are actually 20 feet away.<br /><br />So in conclusion, you have probably guessed that I think the additional cost of the Audio-Technicas are worth it.  In addition to the benefits mentioned above, I have recently been able to get a great deal on a pair of [[ASIN:B00UETOW4C Harmon/Kardon SOHO II NC]] on ebay.  The noise reduction effects of the Audio-Technicas equal or maybe even exceeds those of the Harmon/Kardons. You get two types of noise cancelling with this. First, there's some noise blocking just from having these stuck in your ears. Then the active noise cancelling works quite well. But you have to have them stuck in your ears really firmly, which isn't too easy for me. I suppose it all depends on the shape of your ears. You get several sets of tips, but none of them seem to fit me quite right.<br /><br />The active noise cancelling works better than I expected. It does a better job with low rumbles, like aircraft noise. It's not so good with voices, but it does give you a little bit of reduction there too. I use them in my office, in a somewhat busy environment.<br /><br />The sound quality is very pleasing, but it doesn't have the sparkling highs or very deep lows that you get with more expensive earphones or earbuds. Nevertheless, the sound is smooth and well balanced, so it's comfortable to listen to.<br /><br />For the price, I'm pretty happy. The earbuds are very large, if you have small ears. The other issue is that the callers I spoke to reported a lot of background noise, even with the noise cancellation turned on.",0.0,3
B004OVECU0,3,3.0,1,2,"I have a 60&#34; LG webOS 4K UHD TV, a Samsung soundbar, a Sony Blu ray player, and a DirectTV cable box. I'm not a gamer, but I use Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc. a LOT.<br /><br />I didn't find this Logitech Harmony remote to be even remotely (pardon the pun) sophisticated enough to handle the series of commands required to change inputs. (I never did find a way to add and name an HDMI 2 input based on the downloadable set up instructions.)  Logitech's hardware setup interface is attractive enough, but I didn't find it particularly user-friendly or adequately interactive.  Once I had the remote set up, I realized that one has to start from ALL COMPONENTS OFF (including the cable box) to move through the various commands to get to the activity intended ...and, as I said, even that won't take you all the way through without grabbing the old remote.  No point for the universal remote then, is there?  Returning this item for a refund.  Keep trying Logitech. I was concerned about programmability of these high end remotes but I found with Logitech's software, this remote was a snap to program using the software. One touch functions turns on all three devices perfectly. The only complaint I could say is there is a small delay of button reaction time compared to OEM remotes so I have to press the up or down buttons and wait a second for it to catch up while scrolling through my DVR selections. Usually leads to overshooting my choice. Other than that, it fully replaces three remotes including a Vizio soundbar which didn't work with any other programmable universal remote. Very happy with my purchase. No issues with battery life. Just go through all the options in the software to customize it the way you wish including how long the remote stays lit up. It's pretty sweet that the remote lights up when you move it. No more looking for the button! Unfortunately it won't control my Amazon Fire TV stick, which has a newer bluetooth or WiFi interface.<br /><br />The evolving consumer device space complicates the universal remote scene.  While remote this may be adequate or good for people who only have IR remote controlled devices, IR (Infrared) alone is not good enough to cover the gamut of newer media devices. So I returned it. If I get a remote I will end up paying more for one that covers more devices. Unfortunately the 'ideal' solutions in this space aren't still completely mature yet, and the really good ones push up between $200-$300. And my requirement is to have two remote controls even if I have one that is a central hub.",0.3333333333333333,2
B004RKQM8I,3,5.0,0,3,"I am no headphone expert. However, I give these 5 stars for their performance over the past month. The sound quality is above my expectations for the price I paid for these. The ear pieces are covered with a very soft leather-like material and is very comfortable. They stay on perfectly while jogging. They do make my ears sweaty but I prefer sweat over using little ear buds as I find them terribly uncomfortable. I would recommend these to my friends! UPDATE: 4/15/15 These headphones have been through a little abuse and are still working like new. :) I just got these today and so far I am loving them. The sound quality is perfect and crystal clear. They are well made and I love the fact the cord is fat and not the thin ones like on most headphones. Hopefully these will last much longer than other headphones I have had in the past. Good sound quality.

B005LKB0IU,3,5.0,0,3,"I've been using these for a few days now and I'm pretty impressed. I use them mainly for listening to audio books & podcasts and some music while working out in the barn or cleaning house, that sort of thing. My normal usage pattern requires comfort when wearing for a couple of hours at a time in some serious heat & humidity outdoors. These Kinivo bluetooth headphones have just enough padding to be comfortable, but not enough to make it hard to hear oustide noises. The distance is pretty decent too - I know for a fact they are recieving & playing a clear signal at least 100 feet from my cell phone out at the barn. Now, that is in a relatively unobstructed line in any direction - just one or two half walls & gates. At home, they work throughout the entire house and only start to break up or lose the signal when I go outside to the yard and leave the phone inside. To my thinking, that's pretty darn good overall reception!<br /><br />I have been VERY impressed with the battery life. Yesterday I was doing a hard clean in the barn and listened to 4 hours of an audio book non stop while I worked. Then got home and used them for another 2 hours straight while cleaning house and the battery was STILL strong. When I do charge these, I use the USB to wall plug adapter thing that came with my Kindle and it works just fine - you can also charge them via the USB on your laptop. I have only used these headphones with my Samsung Galaxy Note cell phone so I can't speak about how well they work with a laptop or other brands of phones. I have taken a couple of calls with the headphones and the sound is clear on both ends, so the microphone works fine. Overall....an excellent purchase! Based on the reviews of these wireless phones, I was concerned that they might not be large enough for my head and neck, and if said head and neck were any larger/thicker, they would likely be too small.  (I wear a size 7-1/8 hat and my neck is 16 inches in diameter.) However, they fit fine, and seem nicely comfortable and lightweight.  The phones do seem rather delicate, so I'm not sure they'd do well at the bottom of a gym bag or left unprotected in direct sunlight on a hot car seat or dash.<br /><br />I had no problem charging and pairing the headset with my Samsung Infuse 4G i997.  The sound quality is not bad for the price point.  I found I had to dial back on the bass settings using my Poweramp player, but the player seems to work well with the phones.  I also bought a Kinovo Bluetooth USB adapter for my laptop, but haven't attempted that pairing yet.  (Also haven't made or received any phone calls, but music quality and comfort are my primary focus.)<br /><br />Overall, three hours after receiving the items I'm very happy with the ""Kinovo Experience.""  Will re-post if my opinion changes. I have been wanting a product like this for years to replace wires when I exercise. So far in 2 months of owning these headphones I have not been disappointed. They fit well on my head (I saw reviews where people were upset about this). I am not picky about sound as some may be so perhaps a $$$ Bose may suit others but for the price this set is not bothering me.<br />I have used it for music (jazz, pop, rock) and even radio app, as well as, to via phone chatting.<br />The only issue I have had is with using my wifi there is a beep and the sound goes in and out. Not sure if this is universal or not but with regular phone (ATT) signal I have no issues on phone or radio app (nobex).<br />The battery lasts they say 8 hours but for me seems MUCH longer. I should say I have not timed it out. The instructions say to let the battery die completely and to charge 3 times to help battery last longer. In two months and what feels like hours and hours of listening I have only charged it I think twice. There is a beep that occurs when the battery is low.<br /><br />As far as use goes... these headphones fit fine when I am jumping on my trampoline so if you are concerned about how they would be while running, I would say they work well.<br />I can go about 20-30 feet before sound goes in and out because of distance. I haven't measured it out but that seems a good estimate.",0.0,3

Thanks Anker for a great product and I'll be purchasing other items from you in the near future. Keep up the great work. Although the action of the keys feel great, the biggest issue with this drive (using with a late-2006 24"" iMac) is that the first 2 keystrokes I typed with the keyboard would never respond - they only seemed to turn the keyboard back on.

I was really surprised at how proactive they were with trying to resolve my issue once I left the 2-star review.<br /><br />They offered an updated product replacement without charge.  However, I have since purchased an Apple brand keyboard.  Otherwise I really appreciate their support.  They offered me a complete refund.<br /><br />So I'm currently waiting on a shipping label to return the keyboard for a full refund (apparently this is a part of their 18 month warranty - good stuff!)<br /><br />Now THAT is customer service.

The I Home worked fine for several years but the sound wasn't as good. Who knew such a tiny cute speaker could have shockingly good sound quality. I'm impressed with this speaker and have it hooked up to my small portable CD player. At night I use the CD player to play calming CDs to get to sleep and during the day I listen to favorite artists with the volume a little higher. When I first got this I thought it wasn't working but silly me, I had not turned it on. The little on switch is so tiny it is easy to miss. I do however wish the USB cord was a little longer.

B009NLTW60,3,4.666666666666667,0,3,"I'm very satisfied with this product. The auto-connect feature is my favorite part. I can leave my phone in my pocket, never having taken it out and still listen to my music on my iPhone (where it left off) and take/make phone calls as well. Very easy to pair my phone with the device. When my car turns off, the device is disengaged and disconnects from my phone. When I turn my car on, it takes about 3 seconds and then I hear a small beep noise, and now I can click the button on the puck which resumes my music/media.<br /><br />Like my title says, this is exactly what I wanted.

I already had a cable with a noise loop shield so all I needed was this part. You can also buy little filter clamps at RadioShack which you would just place right on the cable and should reduce noise. The part was only $3, I just chose to use my existing part instead which I also bought on Amazon<br />([[ASIN:B0031U1ATQ Kensington Reducing SmartPhone including iPhone]]<br /><br />Overall, 5 stars! Great product! The price is right. I'm a happy customer. It was shipped and received sooner than I expected. I am  overjoyed about this product. This Bluetooth receiver works very well. It is small unobtrusive and tasteful looking. It is easy to find a spot for it on the dashboard. Connection is quick and sure. Sound quality is excellent for both music and phone calls. A normal speaking tone is all that is needed rather than thethe semi- shouts for other units. Wiring tends to be long and funky but not especially a big deal. The Bluetooth range is quite long and can be a hassle when receiving phone calls even across the street. The receiver will pick it up and directed to the car leaving you mystified as to why you are not able to hear the phone call. This is true for other units and it is a simple manner to remember to disconnect the receiver before leaving the car. However a shorter range would be nice.

B00AWIPITS,4,3.25,1,3,"This headphones works good enough. I bought this because the Jabra headphones seem to always cut out. I bought the Jabra because they can support 2 devices at one time. These however can not. Also, the loop for the ears don't always work well, but they do manage to stay on the head most of the time. This might be because of my big head, but the issue is no real adjustments can be made. Let me start by saying I don't use the cell phone features of these headphones, so this review is not all encompassing.<br /><br />That said, I was a little disappointed in these headphones.  Although the sound quality is good, the build quality and attention to detail in design could be better.  The control buttons on the right ear are difficult to use as you can't easily feel with your finger where one starts and another begins,  You just have to press in the general area, which is not very reassuring.  The buttons themselves have no raised symbols or any physical element you can touch to let you know you're on a button, let alone the correct one.<br /><br />The build quality is not the best.  The control buttons fit together less tightly than other Bluetooth headphones I've used.  The main play/pause/on/off/pairing button, located in the center of the right earphone in particular seems loose and misaligned.<br /><br />The functions of the buttons work well enough.  However, with some functions, there is no audio feedback.  Having used other headsets that provide a short beep each time a button is pressed, I was a little confused when I first tried these - I'd press pause and the audio would just stop, with no beep.  I suppose some users would find this preferable though.  Some of the button functions, such as play/pause, are not instantaneous.  There's a slight delay (about a second) between the time you press it and the time the audio actually plays or pauses.  I've experienced this with other Bluetooth headsets and it seems to be a common annoyance.<br /><br />Because the fit is somewhat tight, getting the earphones on requires a little manipulation.  I often find I have to guide the tip of my ear into the space between the neckband (the part that holds the earpieces and wraps around your neck) and the earpiece.This is mainly due to the padding on the earpieces.  Once the headphones are on though, they've not uncomfortable.  However, a little more space between the neckband and the top of the earpieces would be an improvement.  Wearing the headphones lying down or with your head against the back of a seat is not uncomfortable for the most part.<br /><br />The charging port is has a rubber cover.  Although it serves a purpose and some might find this helpful, I find it just gets in the way and will likely fall off.  The charging cable is VERY short - about 3 feet, and it comes with no AC adapter, so you'll need to plug it into a USB port for charging - or acquire an adapter so you can use an electrical outlet.  Due to the shortness of the cord, it will likely be inconvenient for use with some outlets.<br /><br />Attaching the charging cord is somewhat difficult.  This is to be expected, I guess, due to the micro-USB size of the plug that goes into the ear piece.  The end of the cord that plugs into the ear piece is tapered on one side, so there's some visual indication of which way it should go in, but it's always a pain trying to insert these kinds of plugs, no matter what the device.  I haven't used the headphones for any great length of time, so I can't comment on the battery life at this time.<br /><br />The fact that these headphones can fold up to a fairly small size is nice and may be helpful to some when traveling.  Typically, I wear them while walking or taking public transportation, so no real advantage for me.<br /><br />I purchased 2 pair of these - 1 for myself and one as a gift.  The ones I bought for myself were to replace a pair of Motorola Bluetooth headphones I thought were malfunctioning.  Whenever I wore them, if I turned my heard too far to the right, the sound would cut out or it would seem to skip slightly.  The first time I tried the Kinivo BTH240 headphones, they did the exact same thing.  Is this something common to Bluetooth devices?<br /><br />All in all, I suppose the negatives I've noted are minor and are likely more personal, but they still prevent me from rating these higher than 3 stars. Great headphones for the money.  This is my second pair.  The last pair lasted about two years and then I bought this newer version.  I use them daily to workout and the batteries last 4-5 hours before needing to be recharged.  These cannot be beat for the price!  A++++ Update: Bluetooth doesn't stay connected to my iPhone or iPad. Returning.<br /><br />The sound is decent, all the ranges seem represented. The one size fits all works for me OK. Adjustable rear head piece would be better. The hang over the ear part is comfortable enough, I've had these on a few hours with no major discomfort. Ran up the stairs, they didn't move. Bluetooth connected with no issues to my iPhone 7.",0.25,3

But it was cumbersome and only had one  speaker. I couldn't wait to get this! I had the PS-100 for several years and loved it, wore it out! So I stuck with the brand. I loved the idea of an amplifier and control so I could change the volume without having to reach for the radio. And I love the slim design of the speaker. My only complaint would be it doesn't have as much bass as the PS-100. But it's well worth it's weight in gold for us night music lovers! This is by far the best pillow speaker I've used.

They did not last very long. Invest in better quality speakers. I didn't even have them cranked up very loud and they just stopped working. Cheaply made. Just received these speakers today. Very easy to install on desktop PC. I like Classical Baroque playing lightly in the background while I'm online and these speakers are absolutely fabulous for this.<br />I put the sub on the floor below my desk off to the left, the two mains on either side of the monitor and checked my audio software settings then fired up some online Baroque live from Zurich and the sound quality was immediately impressive.<br />All power, volume and bass settings are built into a very nice control pod you can place nearby on your desk. I found using a light touch on the sub power gives nice bass accentuation without adding unrealistic and unpleasant booming.<br />The sub is rather heavy with a hefty solid feel to it and it's addition to the sound is substantial even at low volume levels.<br />All in all, I'm very happy and my ears are floating away with the delights of the Baroque era as I type this review.<br />Amazon has got me spoiled with so many fine products and the best customer service on earth.<br />And thanks to Cyber Acoustics for this great audio system priced so reasonably.<br />Edit:<br />Okay, now it's June 19th, I don't like these speakers any more at all.

B00CD1PTF0,4,5.0,0,4,"I installed these on an iMac computer.  The speakers are smaller than I expected from the pictures. They are approximately 7-3/4"" high by 3-1/4"" wide by 5-3/4"" in depth.  Installation was extremely easy and took a few minutes.  The AC power adapter piece slides and locks into the AC power supply.  After that the audio cable gets attached to the right speaker from the computer input to the headphone jack on the back of the computer.  Then the cable rom the left speaker goes into the slot by that name on the right speaker. The AC power adapter then gets plugged into your home outlet and the cable end goes into the jack marked DC power on the right speaker. After this it is just a matter of adjusting the computer volume to 75% on the computer and then turning on the right speaker by adjusting the knob to the volume desired.  One improvement I would recommend is an on/off light for the speakers.<br /><br />On the back of the right speaker, plug another device into the AUX IN to listen to a different audio device.<br /><br />I played a few tunes from an iTunes playlist both with the computer volume and then again with these speakers.  To my ears the sound through these speakers is crisp, clear, and deep.  I love them!  In my opinion, this is another great product from Bose.<br /><br />UPDATE: Watching videos on the iMac with this system is awesome.  My boyfriend and I love the acoustics and feel as if we're in a theatre. This isn't your home theater with that $300 receiver to power your speakers.  That being said, these put out some really great sound for a pair of computer speakers.  And their footprint is average, not too large.  There is no sub in the package, but for my purposes the sound was great without it. I purchased a new desktop computer and I had Bose speakers (basically these) that were over 14 years old and so I decided to pass them on figuring that the PC speaker would work fine with music based on the fact it is 2022.  No such luck - the sound was okay - but for someone who likes to hear all the nuances I decided to purchase a new pair.  Not so easy - I did not want bluetooth, as they do need to be recharged and honestly I just wanted to turn the suckers on and go - - - I decided on these, the price was double what I paid 14 years ago, however I also expected a better product and it is!  Easy to set up (yes the left side cord could be longer, but the sound is awesome!  I was worried they would vibrate on my table as the old ones did (I used a potholder underneath to prevent the noise) but these are a tad larger and much heavier and there is no vibration no matter how loud Imake the speaker.  I don't consider these breaking the bank and back in my high school - college days sound and receivers nearly took an entire wall in a room and were quite costly getting into the higher quality stuff - these smaller speakers can pack an awesome punch - using my Amazon Music set on Ultra High Definition I can't get over the lovely sound.  So for me these are a 10 plus and for someone that wants a nice sound, but not such a hefty price they are worth every penny. Have been using the companion 2 series 2 speakers for several years and was very happy with them.  When I saw the series 3 at a local store I decided to see if they were any better than the series 2.  They are exactly the same size.  They are now black, rather than gray. I like the black more than the gray.  The input jacks are now mini jacks rather than the RCA jacks on the series 2, which is an improvement.  The series 3 can be turned off with the volume control, the series 2 had no on/off control.  It was on all the time.  The series 3 draws so little power I leave them on all the time anyway.  NOW THE BIG QUESTION:  DO THEY SOUND BETTER THAN THE SERIES 2?  In my opinion, they sound exactly the same as the series 2 they replaced. So unless you want any of the features new to the series 3, I would recommend saving your money.  The series 2 was a great product, and so is the series 3.  Bose makes outstanding products.",0.0,2

B00HVLUR54,3,4.666666666666667,0,3,"As a musician with a home studio, I needed some new headphones to track with. These came with good reviews, so I decided to give them a try. Good move on my part... they have a good uncolored sound, cover the ears completely and even come with 2 cables (1 coiled, 1 straight).  I do have a big head (size xxl hat) and proportional ears. I wouldn't say these are &#34;roomy&#34;, but they do just cover my ears and seal around them nicely to minimize any sound leaking. I was trying to choose. Sony MDR-V6 Sony MDR-7506, ATH-M30, ATH-M40... I looked at everything. I found a youtube channel, which plays direct from CD sample, then crossover in sync to various model headphones resampling the sound from the each headphone as it's placed over a foam head. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj69-mWHV3E - The point is, they are trying to reproduce what is heard. Also, I found another youtube channel of a guy who shows various headphones sampled through a graphic analyzer, showing the frequency response.<br /><br />All headphones add something to the signal. So what you hear on one model isn't the same, with another. But of all the head phones, the ATH-M40x was identical in sound reproduction to the original music. You couldn't tell the difference. Why is this important? Two reasons, if you are an audio engineer, you will have a truer sound, what you hear, is what you will get. It goes both ways, what you listen to, will be what the sound engineer intended for you to hear.<br /><br />For music with base, it has good presence, and you can hear details that sound muddy on other head phones. I have been listening to a lot of head phones. You do understand muddy and clarity, once you hear it.<br /><br />With that said, and having spent some time, in store sampling, (note: I must say that the Sonys are really good too. I tried and liked the MDR-V55 as well. It's a DJ headset so it's a bit more base. I felt they were very clear and better than the MDR-X05 hands down.)<br /><br />The ATH-M40x, has removable cables. They are field repairable. And you can choose between three different cables, although two come in the box.<br /><br />They are son tested and approved. Now I have to keep them locked up, joking. They are well built. Some say the ATH-M50x is better. It's also said the M50x sound the same as last year's model, and the M40x sound as good as last year's M50 model too. Which is it? The M40x is specifically flat sounding for audio engineering. The M50x is targeted for the audiophile, with a V shape EQ. The M40x is in the sweet spot, unless you have money to burn.<br /><br />They are a bit tight, but this may be alleviated by exchanging the ear pads with velour pads. This exchange compromises the sound profile a little bit, but makes them more comfortable. You be the judge. I am still waiting to do it myself.<br /><br />(150220) - I made some spelling corrections, fixed typos and wording, for clarity. I love these headphones. I had to buy the velour earpads to replace these stock ones though because the pleather got too hot on the ears. The unfortunate part is that it changed the sound signature a bit.

The sound is rich and full, whether it's paired with my old Sony Bravia TV, iPad2, or Kindle Fire, or connected by AV stereo cable (3.5mm M/M) to my MP3 player's headphone jack.  The volume is controlled by the device the speaker is connected to, or by the plus/minus volume buttons on the speaker itself.  The speaker also has an Aux button for the direct cable connection, and a Skip button that lets you go forward or backward in your music selections.<br /><br />This Bose portable speaker can support two Bluetooth-connected devices at once, so you can switch between two devices (e.g., an iPad and a Kindle Fire) without repeating the pairing process every time.  A great feature!  The speaker automatically connects with the last-connected Bluetooth device, and switches devices when you press the Bluetooth button.  The speaker's voice prompts help you with pairing, and tell you which two devices are currently paired.  The voice prompts can be disabled, if you wish.<br /><br />This Bose speaker is definitely an improvement over the speakers built into my old Sony Bravia TV.  Voices are much clearer--including the dialogue from British TV shows--and the sound is far richer.  Of course, using this speaker instead of a TV sound bar is only a temporary solution, because the speaker needs regular recharging.  When fully charged, it delivers sound for many hours (up to 8) and outlasts the charge on the [[ASIN:B004B8GF7Y TaoTronics® Bluetooth Transmitter]] that I added to my non-Bluetooth-enabled TV.<br /><br />Whether the TaoTronics transmitter was connected to the TV's headphone jack or to the TV's AV ouputs, this speaker paired instantly.  However, when the TV transmitter was connected to the AV outputs, the speaker produced some static unless it was positioned close to the TV.  When the TV transmitter was connected to the headphone jack, the speaker produced no static at all, no matter where it was positioned (within the Bluetooth range).<br /><br />This Bose speaker charges quickly with the included AC adapter and USB cable.  Pressing the speaker's power button produces a battery indicator that glows red, amber, or green to indicate the current level of charge.  The speaker is lightweight enough to carry around in a backpack or tote bag.  There is a case available (see [[ASIN:B00NJGRKG4 Bose SoundLink Color carry case]]), but I don't think a case is needed, because the speaker seems to be sturdily constructed. Totally worth the money to purchase. My husband and I use this speaker all the time. The sound is terrific and it's easily portable. Battery life is pretty good, bluetooth range is solid. I will say that as another reviewer mentioned, I wish it were a bit bigger at the base, maybe more of a trapezoid shape, because it occasionally falls over if bumped. On the other hand, my cat knocked it off a small table onto a hard floor and it simply bounced and didn't (literally) miss a beat. My husband loves it. Sure beats the Shark speaker I bought him.

I don't know why people would spend hundreds of dollars getting a laptop (or why school districts go with ipads) when you can get this for under $50. At this price, you can't afford not to have one (because when the kids demand to get on your tablet, they can beat on this instead of the $800 work issued device they want). Also, if you haven't gone kindle, you need to know that there are thousands of books available for free. This little device will keep you entertained for a long time. Such a great product!  Honestly, this is a steal for all that it can do.  I really just wanted it for reading, listening to audiobooks, watching movies, and listening to music.  Since I always use earphones or a bluetooth speaker, it worked perfectly.  Unlike my iPad, I wouldn't panic if something happened to this little piece of technology--not that I want anything bad to happen!  This tablet is my favorite.  If you just want a tablet for basic things, this is for you! If you're looking for an excellent tablet and e-reader at a great price, look no further. While there are things that it lags with (like playing the Pokemon trading card game, which last I knew, needed to be sideloaded) it does a lot of other things really well. Great experience with watching videos, and reading comics or manga.<br /><br />If you're into hacking your devices, this tablet (well, the 2015 version that I have) does a really good job of running a clean Nexus rom, which gives you a stock Android experience, and access to the Google play store. I have to say, that was probably the best thing I've done with it so far.<br /><br />Expandable storage allows you to carry an entire library with you on the go to make sure that you will never run out of things to do. I keep a 128gb micro SD card in mine, but I wouldn't be surprised if you could slot in a larger card, even though it's only officially rated for up to 128gb.<br /><br />What i'd like to see change for the 2018 version (assuming they do a revamp) would be full 1080p resolution, a snapdragon octacore processor clocked around 2ghz (my free ZTE Blade Zmax has one, and I can't imagine it would be too expensive for them to use it in the fire tablet as well, if even free phones have them now) and 2-3 gb of ram. If Amazon would just do these 3 little upgrades, this tablet would be unbeatable. I wouldn't even mind a mild price bump ($70-80 instead of $50) if these upgrades happened. I would also like to see a future version either running full stock Android OS, or released with the option to unlock the bootloader somehow, to facilitate diy development and cutom roms. But I know that's just asking too much.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great tablet at an even better price, the Fire 7&#34; is a great choice.",0.0,1
B00VWEK4IG,5,4.2,1,4,"I bought a Bluetooth speaker not realizing that my laptop didn't have onboard Bluetooth. This doesn't get along very well with the speaker, but I don't think it's a problem with the Bluetooth adapter. signal is pretty strong, I can take the speaker outside of my house a ways and it still works. laptop bluetooth failed. this was a quick and easy fix. Set up effortlessly and works like a charm. Lousy tech here.  It does work some, however, not well at all.  Let me repeat, it does not work well at all. I guess you get what you pay for.  Forget streaming music to a bluetooth speaker, it will only work in spurts.  A real waste of hard earned money! I bought this because my laptop would not find my cricut with bluetooth.  I plugged this in and immediately linked up with my CRICUT JOY. Just plug and play. That easy. Love it. Plugged in to my laptop and was able to send my music to my BOSE speaker. Great work together! Love it",0.2,1
B00VXS8E8S,3,5.0,0,3,"Easy to set up, configure, and link to WiFi.  Speakers are full-toned with good bass qualities, and the uplink with Alexa is completely reliable.  Alexa does all the work, you just sit back and enjoy. Here is a short summary - good speaker, I bought it to play music outside (on my patio). I love the fact that it's a wifi speaker - so it's not dependent on my phone.<br /><br />I'm sure you've had someone be the &#34;DJ&#34;, and the music stops because they got a phone call, or they walk away and the music starts skipping. Not an issue with the tap.<br /><br />The bass could be stronger, but the quality is definitely nice and it gets loud enough for my needs.<br /><br />***UPDATE - 4/12/2017***<br />My Tap speaker is still in wonderful working condition - even though I left it out in the rain for 1-2 nights. It's funny when people think it works like the Echo and try to talk to it (without tapping the button!). :) I find the skill set/setup dubious and the Alexa app was slow and very glitchy. This review is strictly about the device as a streaming Wi/Fi/Bluetooth speaker and sound quality.<br /><br />I am an Amazon Prime customer and all my music is on Amazon streaming. Both ease of use (on Amazon Music/Pandora, etc. only) and sound in one word, Superb! I'm completely surprised because I own the $200+ UEBoom (which has been sitting unused on a shelf, I had to go look for it) and assumed the sound on that would be much superior as reviews and it's reputation suggest. Not so! I just listened back to back.<br /><br />Without intending to compare them, I got my UEBoom to play while I setup the marvelous SOAIY Aurora projector (upgraded version), and in the back of my mind notice the music, not played very loudly because it's nighttime, was rather muddy; I think it wows people for its volume and base. On a whim I switched to my new Amazon Tap received today (I hadn't much time to experiment with it) and... Wow! Fantastic sound quality! Much more enjoyable than the popular UEBoom.<br /><br />Better flat frequency response like a pair of reference headphones (like the Sony Studio MV6 I prefer), more clear definition and detail, not muddy, better treble response (I don't mean tinny or lack of bass), and bass rivaling that of UEBoom. Oh, the main thing I noticed also, which confused me at first, is the wide stereo dispersion (?), um, I mean wide field effect and stereo separation. I literally looked at the cylinder puzzled as to what I was hearing and mentally verifying only this device was on and was the source of the sound I was hearing.<br /><br />The UEBoom always sounded merely monaural from one sourcepoint; this sounded like surround sound effect applied to a two-speaker (not 5.1+) tv. I was amazed at what my senses were reporting to me. Okay, I'm going to say it, to my ears, and I have a class D amplifier and 5 pairs of quality headphones of different brands, the sound of this Amazon Tap is superior, right out of the box. I was amazed. And of course streaming directly sans device is certainly more convenient. It &#34;just works&#34;. (After connecting to your Wi-Fi network.)<br /><br />I learned to say &#34;playlist rock&#34;, since I have a playlist named rock, or it will play all my Amazon music in the genre &#34;rock&#34;. I did ask for the weather after entering my zip code through the Alexa app, which I dislike, and it responded with detailed information. Luckily music playback works directly without a need for app use. I will now mention this superior sound quality is half the price of it's aforementioned similar-sized competitor. I'm now really glad I bought it :)<br />***<br />Update:  I returned it. It couldn't find a track in my music library, I checked title of track and found it instantly on my Fire, but the Tap still couldn't find it; everything I've tried to do with it either completely fails, or I resort to a different device because it's quicker and more convenient. It's mistaken &#34;no&#34; for &#34;yes&#34; and when asking for Julie Andrews started playing the soundtrack to Fifty Shades of Gray. It's been sitting on the kitchen counter unused. I could spend the money elsewhere better (I purchased two Fire HD 6&#34; tablets which are excellent, speedy devices and fit into my front pocket). To each their own.",0.0,4
B00X5P8BJO,3,3.6666666666666665,0,3,"Bought this instead of buying a surface keyboard case for my Microsoft surface. I was impressed with the speed of the Bluetooth connection. I was even more impressed with the build quality. There was little to no keyboard flex at all, and the casing is actually made of what looks like a brushed aluminum. Keystroke is surprisingly long for how thin the keyboard is, but has good feel. I only would not recommend this for gaming because of its size. However, it's size does bring it extreme portability. I love the backlight as well, it really does help with dark situations. My only complaint, is that the backlight only has two colors, instead of being a true RGB light. This keyboard is easy enough to connect by bluetooth and has nice keys. It comes with a small piece of no-slip backing to help keep it in place. it is extraordinarily light and easy to carry around with you. I used it with the ipad 6th gen and had no problems with it whatsoever. The backlight is nice and bright and it is very inexpensive, so it worked quite well as a replacement keyboard that will not get as much use as the one for my computer does. Although it is lightweight, it has a nice solid feel as far as how it was manufactured and none of the keys stick or miss.<br /><br />It is big enough to be comfortable if you are used to a laptop keyboard, but small enough that you can easily stick it in a bag to take with you if you want to work on the go. I am really impressed with this brand and with this keyboard in particular. I would definitely recommend this for someone looking for a simple, practical keyboard. There are not a lot of bells and whistles with this product, but it is good at what it does and helps with productivity. I really want to love the Arteck HB030B Universal Slim Portable Wireless Bluetooth keyboard. You can't beat the price, and I purchased it because my MacBook Pro has a messed-up butterfly keyboard, so I was seeking a cost-effective solution to tide me over until I can get it fixed during this pandemic.<br /><br />I find myself going back to my MBPro keyboard because the key travel to be very stiff, especially on such a compact, lightweight keyboard. It's just not working right, and since I am not a touch typist, I am looking at what I am doing. When I look up, I find it is typing keys I never hit and there is a lot of lag time.<br /><br />If you are a touch typist, you will be very unhappy. I have key repeat turned off on my computer. yet keys on this keyboard are occasionally repeating.<br /><br />I was considering leaving all the mistakes in but wanted others to be able to read this clearly. This will probably be returned.<br /><br />Update 10/27/2020<br />The seller provided excellent customer service and offered to send me a replacement. I have the feeling it won't be any different. The key travel and stiffness is a big issue for me. I subsequently purchased another keyboard from another alphabet soup named manufactured and even though they look identical, the performance is NOT. The key travel is smoother and the brightness of the backlighting and color selection is not even comparable I am very disappointed that this is an Amazon Choice product.",0.0,1
B00X9KV0HU,3,4.333333333333333,0,3,"Although I'm not an audiophile, I wanted to own ONE pair of really good earphones, to use for listening to music with my iPadAir2 and iPodTouch.  These BOSE QUIETCOMFORT 20 ACOUSTIC NOISE CANCELLING HEADPHONES are perfect for me, because:<br /><br />(1) I love the amplified Bose sound;<br /><br />(2) they're comfortable, lightweight earbuds that don't make my ears hurt like over-ear headphones do;<br /><br />(3) they don't bleed sound when they're plugged into the iPad Air2 jack;<br /><br />(4) the noise-cancelling feature is awesome in the way it filters out sound from the surrounding room;<br /><br />(5) there's a button that instantly switches off the noise-cancelling feature when you need to be aware of some sounds in your environment;<br /><br />(6) the battery charges in about two hours, and provides 16 hours of sound;<br /><br />(7) I can still listen to music through the earphones when the battery runs out;<br /><br />(8) the earphones are fitted with soft earpieces (S, M, L sizes included) that keep them from falling out of my ears whenever I move; and<br /><br />(9) the earphones come with a semi-hard protective zippered case for carrying and storing.<br /><br />The digital music on my iPadAir2 sounds infinitely better when played through these earphones (instead of through the tablet's built-in speakers).  I feel like I'm all alone in the middle of a huge orchestral music hall.<br /><br />The noise-cancelling feature completely muted my husband's normal speaking voice, when he was sitting three feet away from me at the dining room table.  I could hardly tell that he was even speaking (though his lips were moving).<br /><br />If you have an iPhone, these earphones will handle your telephone calls, too.<br /><br />These earphones are designed to work with Apple products (for volume control, telephone call management).  There are similar earphones available that are designed to work with Android tablets and cell phones. The noise cancelling works better than hoped for. However, my ears must be different because none of the different sized ear tips will stay in my ear when I am wearing them to walk or do yard work.  I called asking if they have over the ear hooks/adapters to help keep them in place, and there are none.<br /><br />I normally buy regular over the head earphones, and got these because of their noise cancelling properties and because they looked like they would be more comfortable. Our neighbors have a dog that barks all day long (literally) when they leave their home and I wanted peace and quiet when I go outside now that it is warming up and gardening season is here. Like I said, the noise cancelling works great. But, it only works as long as they stay in my ears, so I am using my husbands Bose OE2 headphones instead.<br /><br />If my ears would hold the buds, I would LOVE these. They do work as promised. I am just disappointed there is no such thing as an over the ear clip accessory for those of us with ears that don't do well with them.<br /><br />I called Bose and they are sending me another set of eartips to see if maybe these were just missized or defective. I just bought these wonders yesterday. I choose the earbuds so I can use them in more places like the gym and yard work instead of only on airplanes. They were wonderful at the gym today to block out all the noise from the treadmills and other devices of torture. So far I love them and they really are wonderful for canceling out noise and are wonderful size.",0.0,3
B010OYASRG,19,4.2105263157894735,3,16,"Love my little speaker! I connect it wirelessly Tommy iPod and off to the garden or shower I go! Nice! No wires to trip over or pull on - excellent!!!! They made fun of me when they saw it but now they just say - nice speaker Mom!!!!! I agree 100%!!! Love my speaker and it's all mine. While this little speaker packs a punch volume-wise .. it just lacks the bass that other more expensive speakers have.<br />I do like that it stays ON with my echo dot and aux cable.<br />But music sounds a little too tinny, distorts on higher volume and not enough bass.<br />Still for the price .. it's a decent speaker<br /><br />In the end I went with a JBL FLIP 3 .. and I am a lot happier now :) I teach a HIIT class in the gym. This speaker is just not loud enough. It connects to my phone easy, very small and easy to carry around. Loud enough for maybe an office, but not a gym. Disappointed. I'll be returning. I have a gaming laptop with terrible speakers... I am guessing they expected a gamer to use external or a headset anyway.<br /><br />These are pretty good for it. Best speaker. Period. Not for its price (which is very low) but for its overall performance. Buy it! You wont regret it.<br />Sound quality equals Bose-likes speakers. Arrived fully charged, paired easily with my older Mac even tho other machines with Bluetooth on. It just works! Sweet. Able to connect quite quickly to any device.<br />Just make sure you turn off all the other devices BLUETOOTH, for another device to work I have the OontZ Angle and this one is much louder and has that crystal clean sound.  So much better than my first one and I love the first one.  Driving a school bus I put it in the dash area where the triangular shape fits very well.  And with this new one I shall have much better sound over the engine noises.  Radio is broke on my bus.  And after the kids get off I can increase the volume now!  Easy to set up and use like the first one. I think the battery like is very long.  Just plug it in occasionally. The 3 definitely is worth the upgrade. Still will use the first one and love that blue color! Impressive sound for such small speakers. Big clear sound from a very small speaker.<br />Beat Rokono 10 times over and cost less.<br />Would def recommend<br />Good for movies on chrome book when sound isnt good or loud enough and to listen to music I may want to purchase or just on the computer thats free w my prime subscription.Also when going somewhere I cant take my big boomer , I just hook up the MP3 and can share at the gym or play in the car.<br /><br />It has a good 10 watts, fits in your hand and has a decent bass which was a pleasant surprise . Beautiful sound quality for the price. I bought two. Speakers may be Bluetooth or auxiliary wired. Great deal. I needed a small blue tooth speaker because the Echo Dot sound quality just wasn't cutting it and i would like to add music to whatever room I am working in that may not have a device. I have an Echo Dot 2nd and 3rd gen. The 2nd gen is tinny and the 3rd way too bass centric and boomy, but still better than this speaker. The sound quality doesn't blow me away, in fact, it is pretty bad. Not enough bass and not much of an improvement over my Echo Dot Mini 2nd Gen. Wow, this is so disappointing. The speaker paired easily with my phone and laptop, but had an issue pairing with the Alexa app via blue tooth. The controls are a pain to see in low light. As long as you keep your expectations super low you will be happy.<br />----Update-----<br />Lost another star after buying the Doss Touch speaker for $4 more. The Doss has MUCH better sound quality and paired to Echo Dot instantly. The Oontz seems to be having difficulties with Alexa. Probably going to return this and buy the upgraded version of the Doss 20W because I am much more impressed with that speaker as a whole. The sound quality on the Doss is more balanced and it has True Wireless Stereo so both can be used simultaneously. At first it was about being an upgrade to the Echo Dot sound quality, but now it's about better sound with every device. I was never happy with the sound on the Oontz to begin with and now it's completely unacceptable after trying a much better speaker within the same price range. Good sound but not much range on Bluetooth I returned this product due to a subpar low range... The treble was decent, the bass was truly non existent.  I'm not an audiophile, however, my primary home theater speakers are Bang & Olufsens. I read a lot of reviews on how these speakers sounded, however, I was not impressed.  I have bose soundlink mini, this was about 20% of the bass of the bose.  If you are looking for full sound you will want to look further.  If you want an inexpensive speaker for work, or somewhere that bass is not a necessity this will be fine. What a powerful little speaker!!! I was surprised by the excellent sound quality!  Small enough to take with you and get great sound wherever you may roam! We use this occasionally it's okay. Not extraordinary. Pretty much what you expect from a speaker around $20 This speaker is awesome. Its loud and sounds really great for its price I bought these speakers a few days ago for our pick up basketball games, and it's mind blowing how loud these speakers can get! They're small enough to carry around anywhere you go, and loud enough to amaze you. I recommend it . Great purchase . I like this speaker! The case is very worth it, also! Watch this little guy....the bass will bump your Bluetooth speaker and make it move....I'm very impressed<br />Great sound I'm very pleased with my Bluetooth speaker<br />Thanks Amazon 😊",0.15789473684210525,0
B015TJD0Y4,11,4.545454545454546,0,11,"So... I own both the tower and now several dots.  Of course the dots are more reasonably priced, however, the speaker ability is really where it's vastly different.  Obviously the tower is much better in the speaker department.  However, I did find that there is a cordless speaker you can buy to go with your 2nd gen dot that is an improvement and still at lower price point than the tower when combined with the cost of the dot. (Mokcao cordless speaker - amazon sells it too) Because the dots are so reasonably priced we have them in all 3 major rooms and use the cordless speaker to drop one dot in and take it outside to our sunroom when we like.  Over all, I am pleased with both my tower AND dots... but probably will stick to dot purchases in the future because of the price point.  I would say if you've been on the fence, the dot is well worth a try.  It's very easy to set up, you will need to download the app, also easy to follow step by step setups.  Once you're hooked up you will be amazed at how often you use Alexa.  At our house she helps me keep track of where I am supposed to be every day... timers... night time meditation... the occasional argument and even plays games with us as well as much needed comedic relief.  It may not be &#34;necessary&#34; to have Alexa, but I am always surprised at how often we use her assistance.  It's nice and worth it to us.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. We're still getting to know each other. I can't get schedule reminders, or Bluetooth syncs. What's funny is if the tv is on and &#34;she&#34; hears her name &#34;she&#34; perks up. Don't let an Alexa commercial come on... too funny. I already have an Echo, which I love and wanted another Alexa for my crafting room. I was a little leery of trying the Dot because of the many reviews regarding poor sound quality. I was pleasantly surprised with my new Dot - I find the sound quality to be quite decent for this very compact design. I already had a small portable speaker that I cabled into the Dot and now it sounds just as good as my full-size Echo. It was very easy to set up this Dot and all my Alexa skills that I had previously set up with on my Echo worked immediately with the Dot. I didnt have to do anything else.  If you have never used Alexa I would highly recommend you give it a try. The Dot is a very economical way to try it out and once you do, you will be hooked. you no longer have to carry your smart phone with you from room to room to listen to music, audible books, podcasts, news, weather.......<br />Love my Echo and now I also love my Dot. Thanks Amazon! I purchased the Echo Dot 2 after hearing about it over a dinner with friends. My main reason was for using it as a speaker, but have found the alarm and reminder system so helpful. Even the games are enjoyable. Well I really like the echo dot. The speaker is ok but I added another speaker for music.just wish it had a off switch. I am very happy with my dotty! Plugged right into my home network and became the boss of the house! Voice recognition is great and I think it's making the older siblling Alexa a bit jealous. Alexa got reassgined from my bedroom to the living room.<br /><br />The sound is really booming for such a little cutie! Love the fact that it connects to my bluetooth speaker so nicely! I ordered a three pack because I wanted one for my music room, living room and one for my girlfriend. Set up was super simple for the basics - connecting to a bluetooth speaker, your calendar (I use google's calendar), and a music source. For the latter I use Pandora and that, too, was simple.<br /><br />The subtracted star is because while I own a few thousand dollars worth of MP3 albums that I purchased from Amazon, I cannot access them. Apparently you can only stream music from Amazon's cloud if you have Prime, and even then I am not sure that you can access any of your own music that resides in their cloud. To me that is a fail, and an indication that the business and requirements analysts who assisted in the development of this device do not fully understand customer requirements at a very basic level. Another nit is the iHeart Radio music source that is plain confusing to use.<br /><br />Some other areas where this would be a LOT more useful is to have the ability to set up more than one route for traffic (currently I can only identify a single route, home-to-work or back, whereas I am frequently traveling from one place to the other and traffic conditions for those trips would be very helpful.  The same for the calendar: you can get all events for a single day, but not for a week, or weekend so you still have to fire up a calendar app on your phone, tablet or computer if you want to get a sense of how busy you will be over a period longer than a day.<br /><br />Still, for fifty bucks each - plus the discount for purchasing a three pack - this is a decent device that has proven to be surprisingly useful in my home. My girlfriend instantly took to hers too. In the week or so that I have been using it I find that I am growing increasingly dependent on mine for streaming music from Pandora, looking up quick information while I am reading or watching a documentary, and letting me know what is on my calendar for a specific day.<br /><br />I have one of mine connected via bluetooth to a [[ASIN:B019PGACR0 LD Systems MAUI 5 Channel PA System]], and my girlfriend has hers connected to a [[ASIN:B00W8O6MJO Creative Sound Blaster Roar 2 Portable NFC Bluetooth Speaker]], both of which greatly out perform the larger Echo.  However I also use my other Dot with just its integrated speaker and it is more than adequate, even for streaming music since I have it on an end table.<br /><br />Overall, for the current fifty bucks this is a bargain (warts notwithstanding), and while I purchased mine more out of curiosity all three have proven to be useful and practical. The speaker is too tinny sounding for anything other than the alexa voice, but I have it paired to an existing  quality bluetooth speaker that I owned, which was my plan all along, and I'm satisfied with that. If you don't have an existing external bluetooth speaker, I'd go with the full sized echo instead. I've listened to that speaker several times and it is pretty good. Alexa is great! She answers your questions, tell you the weather, controls your Bluetooth speakers, can control your lights or electronics with added technology. She has her own free games you can play with the family on Alexa. i love my Echo Dot but i am still learning but right out of the box she can do all the basic things you want. the possibilities are endless and there are more things added all the time for the Echo dot. i have it hooked up to my JBL Extreme Bluetooth speaker and it is wonderful. i know the time is coming that almost everyone will have one because it is definitely the future. i have 4 of these Dots in my house now, they are great. I have 2 white and 2 black.  I have 2 of them plugged into the TP Link Smart plug, so i just say &#34;Alexa, turn lamp off&#34; and Poof, my lamp goes off and i don't have to get out of bed!  Lazy i know, but i'm just so tired at the end of the day!<br /><br />When you have multiple dots, they can talk to each other..  For Example..  I'm in my room, i say &#34;alexa, call sons room&#34;  his Dot rings, and he says &#34;alexa, answer&#34;  then we can talk like we are on the phone.  then say &#34;alexa, hang up&#34; when your done..<br />So.. on those days that you are sick, or just had surgery and need a coke delivered to your room, you no longer have to use a bell, yell or reach to your nightstand for your phone to text anyone.<br /><br />The Dot doesn't have the best sound quality when playing music, nor is it very loud.. I don't recommend for a party.  Unless you have it bluetoothed to a BOSE portable speaker, which i do, and then your golden!<br /><br />I am a real person, that really bought this item.

So this was a perfect marriage between old and new.<br /><br />Connects really quick with my Samsung S7 and Amazon Echo Dot. I had to admonish my S7 not to connect automatically with it every time I had the two close by. Same with my Echo. After a few stern commands, these pairs are behaving.<br /><br />Set up was no issue at all. The sound is crisp and clear, although my Amp warbles a bit if I switch it to this device and I haven't connected the source via Bluetooth yet. Not sure if this ""warble"" is present in the signal after connecting though. My ears aren't that awesome to pick up something like that.<br /><br />Yet.<br /><br />Maybe when I have bionic ears, it might pick up the ""warble"". 😏🤔😊 Bought this to update an old am/fm tuner with speakers. It is fantastic and simple to set up. OK, it's easy to use and works great!  Now, the rest of the story:  When you use it, it identifies itself as headphones.  Seems ok, but then you leave the house with your phone and you will miss every call and audible notation because it thinks it is still connected to headphones.  The solution is simple -- you must go into your phone settings and select bluetooth>Esinkin BT Adapter>Forget this Device.  That's right, every time you want to use it you have to pair it and then Forget it when done.  Simply ""disconnecting"" it only lasts a few seconds and your phone returns to headphone mode.  Now, if I am all wrong about this, please correct me and let everyone else know.  This would be great for a retired phone you use as your music box and stays connected to your sound system all the time.  But for an active phone, it's a PIA.",0.0,4
B016P9HJIA,4,3.5,1,3,"Very disappointed in the speakers. The reviews where good so I was surprise how lousy the sound was. Not sure why anyone would rate them better then one star.. Ok, I can't give you the detailed run down of all the good and amazing things those speakers can do (not a tech buff), BUT, they sound soooo much better than my old set. I originally bought them for my TV/Receiver, since our boxes there don't do much anymore. I (again not tech person) had no idea that those can't be used with my yamaha receiver, so this is something to keep in mind while ordering them. I decided to use them with my PC, since I listen to a lot of Pandora and I can tell you, the difference is astounding. We had a pretty good set of PC speakers and we do listen to a lot of rock and metal music, but those blew me away. They are a bit pricy for PC speakers, but I will keep them anyway, the sound is just too good. Based on all the good reviews I gave this a try.  Sadly I was disappointed.  Yes, they look good but just sound fair in my opinion.  I find the bass response lacking when compared to a Lapai amp driving Micca Club speakers.  Don't get me wrong, they don't sound terrible, but just not the sound I was expecting.  I realize that everyone has different tastes, so this is only one mans opinion....<br />UPDATE:  I have changed my original 2 star rating to 4 stars.  Reason being I was originally not happy when connected to my computer.  But I purchased an Amazon Dot and now I am pleased with the bass response of these units.  However, I must admit that still prefer the Bose Companion 2 speakers to these which are priced the same.  Again, this is only my humble opinion..... I bought these to replace my wimpy stock computer speakers. My first reaction was that they were not very crisp and that they lacked even representation in the lower range. After listening for a while I like them enough to keep them. they do have some lower range, but they have to be turned up for it to come through. The speakers are a little larger than what I was expecting for my desk, but they are definitely an upgrade. I prefer the sound quality from my Sony Bluetooth speaker, but these get loud enough to fill the room whereas my old speakers were lacking in every way.<br />Thanks for the affordable quality! Maybe I can find an equalizer program that will help even out the bass.<br />EDIT:<br />Equalizer fixed the issue with the uneven bass. This was Windows' problem not Edifier's.",0.25,2
B016XTADG2,16,4.1875,2,14,"Easy to use - great battery life - pretty good sound for such a small speaker!  What else could you want??  Definitely worth the money. This Bluetooth speaker is the best I’ve ever run across!  My son bought one, and I as SO impressed that I bought one, too!  I use it with 2 iPad mini’s and my iPhone XR, and my son uses it on his Android phone, with the same great results. The charge lasts forever and the quality is amazing!! {And no, I am NOT being paid for this review. What you read is what I mean.} Given the quality of this speaker, the price is incredible! I own the A3143 Premium Stereo Bluetooth speaker (2x10W=20W) which sounds great, but it doesn't have a microphone or the longer battery life of this lower-cost A3102 SoundCore speaker (2x3W=6W).  The features and sound characteristics are different, but which is the better choice depends on personal preference.  To me based on sound quality alone, the A3143 wins hands down. The bass is stronger (more power is required to drive the lower frequencies than the higher frequencies), but I also find overall frequency response to be more balanced and accurate for instruments and vocals. For either speaker, I'd recommend using an EQ app to set the frequency response and spatial effects to your preference (I use Bass EQ from Coocent).  Interestingly, the maximum volume level for both the A3143 and this A3102 SoundCore are about the same.<br /><br />The A3102 has a brighter sound overall.  The A3102 is good as a general purpose speaker, and it is excellent to use with a cell phone.  The A3102 microphone (which the A3143 doesn't have) and speaker quality for voice calling are crisp and clear.  My dad who can't hear very well often could not understand me on my cell phone handset or its speakerphone, but had no problem when I used the A3102.<br /><br />So for long battery life, good overall music speaker, and particularly for use as a microphone/speakerphone for voice calls, A3102 is a good choice.  For best music reproduction, the A3143.  For either, Anker's quality and customer support are among the best in the industry. First off, I am not an audiophile. This is a review from a simple person who wanted music at work.<br /><br />I am a Rural Carrier for the United Stated Postal Service. I deliver mail in an LLV truck and these vehicles are basically mobile tin cans. Every panel rattles, making for quite an unpleasant environment, audio wise. I tried playing music directly off my phone, but alas my speakerphone is only so loud and is constantly drowned out by the LLV.<br /><br />So, I researched Bluetooth speakers and, based on the reviews and popularity, recently purchased two:<br />-[[ASIN:B016XTADG2 Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker with 24-Hour Playtime, 66-Foot Bluetooth Range & Built-in Mic, Dual-Driver Portable Wireless Speaker with Low Harmonic Distortion and Superior Sound - Black]]<br />-[[ASIN:B01LZV6TYQ OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Splashproof Bluetooth Speaker - Designed & Engineered by Cambridge SoundWorks for Richer Bass, HD Sound, and 30-Hour Playtime, 10W+ Power, Water Resistant, Portable Wireless Speaker]]<br /><br />The Anker SoundCore is being returned while I am keeping the OontZ Angle 3 Plus and here is why.<br /><br />I tested both speakers in my home at first. My very first impression, out of the box:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - was nice to touch and just felt solid and very well built.<br />Anker SoundCore - just felt like a simple lightweight brick. It really didn't give the impression of longevity or durability.<br /><br />The set-up guides were quite different from each other.<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - Extremely easy to read, follow and understand (remember, I am not a music nut lol. This was my first time ever using a Bluetooth speaker and was in completely uncharted territory.) It was all in English, and only English and the diagrams were detailed and made the entire set-up process seamless and carefree.<br />Anker SoundCore - This guide was very hard to follow. It is printed in darn near every language, in tiny print and the diagrams were quite small as well. I ultimately did get the speaker paired with my phone and figured out what buttons did what, but it took nearly 15 minutes to do so.<br /><br />Bluetooth Pairing<br />With both speakers and my phone lined up on a table (well within the proximity specified in each set-up guide), both speakers paired, however:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - MUCH faster in pairing (mere seconds!).<br />Anker SoundCore - took nearly two minutes to complete the pairing process.<br /><br />Pause/Play Button<br />Since I dismount to deliver packages to a customer's door routinely on my route, I really need to have a simply way to pause my music. I really like how both speakers offer this function on directly on the units, saving me from having to handle my phone.<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - I barely press the Play/Pause button and the speaker immediately reacts. There is NO hesitation.<br />Anker SoundCore - I press the Play/Pause button and there is a delay of about 5 seconds.. just long enough to make me think I didn't press hard enough and reach to do it again only for the speaker to finally react.<br /><br />Volume/Overall Playback Quality<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - Wow. Just wow. It is truly unbelievable to hear such full sound, and bass(!), coming from such a small unit. I found myself perfectly pleased with the output without ever reaching max volume on the speaker itself. So I am looking forward to how well it will work in my LLV during my first road test. As for now, I am thoroughly impressed!<br />Anker SoundCore - I maxed out the volume on my phone and the speaker and was just not impressed. If I could guess, I'd say the max output this speaker achieved was only about 25% more than my speakerphone alone (while the OontZ Angle 3 Plus blew it out of the water with close to double, if not more, output than my speakerphone alone).<br />I also noted some kind of distortion or interference type background sound with the Anker SoundCore at mid volume and above.<br /><br />Speakerphone/Mic<br />I was able to answer an incoming phone call on both units as described in each set-up guide. The quality of in-call sound on each speaker differed:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - My husband's (the caller) voice was crisp and clear, as if he was sitting talking right next to me. There was no distortion or feedback out of the speaker. Husband reported nothing but a clear voice on his phone.<br />Anker SoundCore - Husband's voice was clear, but echoed horribly. No matter what volume level I used. There was no distortion (I was expecting this given the distortion with the music playback) bu the continuous echoing is a major issue for me. Husband reported a slight &#34;faded&#34; type of echo on his phone.<br /><br />Road Test (in my LLV)<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - The sound is amazing in the truck! Thinking I would need it, I maxed the volume on both the speaker and my phone then pressed play on my music. Well, I certainly don't need max volume. I reduced the volume on both the speaker and my phone and found a very happy medium output. This speaker performs perfectly in the loud, rattling setting of a USPS LLV.. even while bouncing down rural dirt two tracks and washboard gravel roads. I am extremely pleased with this tiny speaker.<br />Anker Soundcore - Even with maxed volume settings, I could not get this speaker to perform anywhere near as well as the OontZ Angle 3 Plus. It had volume and was loud enough to hear over the vehicle's own noise, however the distortion/interference mentioned earlier was still present and in the truck during the road test it had what I would describe as an echoing effect on the music, specifically the singers' voices. It just wasn't clear. (I hope that makes sense.)<br /><br />Battery Life/Listen While Charging<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - So far, the battery life is impressive. After receiving it, I charged it overnight (as recommended). I then had it connected to my phone for about an hour of home testing. Turned it off and I next used it at work on a Saturday.. had it powered on and connected to my phone and actively playing music for about 5.5 hours. I then used it again on Monday (much longer and busier days in the USPS, FYI).. had it on, connected and active continuously for nearly 9 hours. I have yet to see the low battery light come on. I plan to see just how many days of work I can get out of a single charge.<br />Anker Soundcore - I have no information for this section on this speaker since I am returning it.<br /><br />Exterior/Cleaning<br />At first, I had the OontZ Angle 3 Plus setting on the dashboard of the LLV. This didn't last more than two stops. Despite having the four rubber &#34;feet&#34;, the speaker still slid around causing more of a distraction than I would like. I ended up setting it on top of my personal bag, in a bin by my feet with the speaker facing up. This move really helped my piece of mind, knowing it will not go anywhere. This speaker has a soft rubber exterior. It is quite nice and feels luxurious, however... this exterior attracts all dust particles within 50 feet! USPS LLVs are *not* known for being the cleanest and even though I moved the speaker from the dust-ridden dashboard to a bin, it was still slathered with dust and dirt by the end of my route. I figured it was a fair trade, sacrificing the appearance for the gain of having decent music. But.. I got home and went to clean it. I will tell you, my expectations of this working were very low. I didn't think the dust would come off that supple rubber. But with a wet paper towel and a few slow wipes, it did. So, it can be cleaned up!<br /><br />Case<br />I did purchase the case for this speaker ([[ASIN:B01NBDY6VP [Official] OontZ Angle 3 Plus Bluetooth Portable Speaker Carry Case, Neoprene with Aluminum Carabiner, reinforced zipper, by Cambridge SoundWorks [NOT FOR OontZ Angle 3]]]). I was mainly wanting a safe way to transport and store the speaker, but after reading the other reviews I was hoping I would be able to keep it clean in the case and still enjoy my music on my route. I received the case and used it yesterday. The case is extremely nice and I appreciate the interior mesh pocket. I have no need for it now, but I'm sure it will come in handy if I ever take this speaker on vacation and need to take the charging cables along. As for playback while in the case? Yeah, it was terribly muffled. It didn't work for me as it apparently has for others. Yet, the case itself is exactly what I was wanting for taking it to and from work. It is not as thickly padded as I would have expected, however it does protect the speaker.<br /><br />Overall, for my specific purpose and intended use for a Bluetooth speaker, the Anker SoundCore simply won't cut it. However, it is still a nice speaker and will perhaps fit your needs perfectly. After all, most people don't drive LLVs and have the same high demands that go along with that. For me, the OontZ Angle 3 Plus is what I'll be bopping down the road to, mailbox to mailbox.<br /><br />Happy hunting! Hope this review helps you out! UPDATE: This speaker, like every Anker product I've owned, is quality!! I charge on Sunday night, use it average  4 hours a day, and the charge lasts a whole 6 days if not the entire week. Rarely does the charge expire before I put it back on to charge on Sunday night (if it does it is Sunday morning). The sound quality is unparalleled and the durability is fantastic (I'm not constantly dropping it or anything but I've probably dropped it a few times).<br /><br />Original Review: My ex-boyfriend had one and he’d  bring it when he’d come over. All I had was a giant early 2000s Apple speaker that weighs 20 pounds and had cost over $400 new... it doesn’t move off the top of my fridge much - lol. This is AWESOME!! The sound, the portability. Highly recommend!! Very impressed with this speaker. I play a lot of dubstep and the bass is pretty good wuality. Not as loud as I’d like it to be but I really struggle with finding good portable speakers with good bass and this is the best I’ve found so far. Really great speaker! Battery lasts! Really great purchase. Shockingly good speaker for the price! Doesn’t go super loud without distorting a little, but loud enough to hear in two rooms at a time or in the shower without distorting— would totally buy again for the price. Superb speaker that is perfect in every way!! We tried it with music, commentaries, loud, soft, and range ..... This speaker has very good sound quality. Battery charge is long lasting, its also light on weight without compromising workmanship !!! Update: hate this speaker. Attempting to reconnect via Bluetooth after another device was connected is a hassle. I have to forget the speaker exit Bluetooth setting then come back in wait for it to show up and then re connect. No other Bluetooth device has been this awkward.<br /><br />Amazing battery life. Not much else. Good sound. Not a lot of bass though. A &#34;feature&#34; that I don't like is that it has no auto off. To make that worse, it will beep at you every 10? minutes to let you know it's looking to pair with a device until you manually turn it off. It's actually quite annoying. Re-pairing to my phone after my wife's phone was connected is an ordeal. Putting it in pairing mode doesn't just allow me to connect to it. I have to first Forget the device from my Bluetooth settings, then since the device doesn't show up in my iPhone's list of bluetooth devices in pairing mode, I have to turn off bluetooth, turn on bluetooth, wait for it to show up, then connect. Doing this every time we want to stream from a different device? Forget about it. Strangest Bluetooth experience I've ever had. I was surprised by the sound of this speaker, I would buy this again for sure! We love this speaker! We've had it going on 6 years now and it is still going strong. We've been so impressed with both its sound quality and battery life that we bought a second one for the other floor in our house.<br />If you're on the fence with this speaker - get it! This is an awesome speaker. So small yet so powerful! I have a bose soundlink mini... this thing sounds like a clock radio compared to it... no bass, glassy sound... ugh, now I have to return it.  I also have a ihome single channel 3&#34; tiny speaker from 6 years ago and that sounds better. A good average speaker. Good sound crystal clear. Not as loud but nice. Had to call for initial Bluetooth. They were helpful and I was stupid. Just hold the on button longer.",0.125,0
B0186SDYZU,3,3.6666666666666665,1,2,"[[VIDEOID:90e56caf53bb9127a941c450bd417db8]] A battery-powered radio receiver is a good piece of equipment to have on hand when there is an emergency. It can be used to receive important information when there is no power otherwise available. This particular receiver works well and it has the distinction of being one of the smallest receivers I have ever used. It is about the size of a cell phone and it is able to receive shortwave signals as well as AM & FM stations.<br /><br />This unit is small enough to fit in a pocket and is comparable in size to my iPhone 6 in its case. This makes it ideal for packing along on a trip or keeping someplace where it can be out of the way but ready in an emergency. In my opinion, the size is one of the strongest selling points.<br /><br />Turning it on by the switch does not turn on receiving. This turns on only the power to the LCD and from there the radio can be turned on by holding down the on/off button on the front. This is an interesting way to make sure the radio is not accidentally powered on, though it is slightly inconvenient. This feature suggests the ideal behind this radio is primarily emergency readiness.<br /><br />There are a number of ranges set for AM, FM and shortwave on this radio that correspond to different locales. Operable range in one country may be very different than in another, and by separating these out into preset ranges enables changing the suitability for a locale a matter of pressing a button rather than tracking down a new device. This makes traveling with this radio very workable.<br /><br />After turning it on I have had no issue with finding stations on each appropriate frequency range, though it was easiest finding FM stations due to the prevalence of such in the area where I live.<br /><br />This is an interesting little radio. It works well, and it is able to pick up stations in different regions by simply changing the available range to scan. The size makes it easy to take with you. Though it is most clearly useful as an emergency radio it works well as a general purpose radio too. The price is nice too, making this an easy radio to recommend.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no/minimal cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it. When I was a kid 50 years ago, I asked for a SW radio for Christmas. We got our presents on Christmas Eve and when I took it up to my bedroom, I opened a storm window just enough to hang the extension wire out. I was able to listen to stations all over the world. Russia, England, Japan, India, etc. Didn't matter that I couldn't understand anything but English. These were voices from around the globe!  I felt the world was in my hands. AM and FM, too. Big dial. Yes, the radio was big and bulky and forget any batteries. Power cord was it.<br /><br />I bought this VITE just to see if SW would interest me still. I've only had it for a few hours, and it sure does. It's like my big, bulky radio was somehow shrunken down and forced into this tiny unit and with even more bells and whistles. Seems to be built very well and solid. Powered by 2 AAs. If you had a handheld transistor radio in the 60s, it's even smaller!  Speaker is nothing to brag about, but so what? It's $20 bucks. Nice little SW. I might eventually look at something more powerful. Seemed to have a good battery life as I used two very old double A's from a travel shaver and still worked in the morning.  However the electronic controls are glitchy,  and after trying it awhile it started turning itself off after 60 seconds.  I cut power side switch,  took batteries out but couldn't fix it.  Shame because I was just beginning to really like it.  Has great receptivity and got a few SW stations in afternoon,  queerly not at night; may be my area.  Can't beat the price I would've kept it if it kept working despite the glitchy controls.<br /><br />I ordered a Tecsun PL-310ET for side knob and antenna jack, and a review showing it was a little more receptive and warmer audio than the PL-380. If you're strapped for cash I'd suggest spending just a few more bucks and getting the Tecson PL-9012 currently on Amazon for $22 instead of this one.",0.3333333333333333,1
B01AWLPUAG,3,2.6666666666666665,1,2,"After a lifetime of working in and around industrial sites my husband is a bit hard of hearing. We are constantly battling over the sound of the TV... I can hear normally, so when he puts the sound at level he can hear the conversations, it feels like it is blasting our my ear drums!  We've had several sets of headphones... they are uncomfortable and he then can't hear me if I am asking him something...  so we decided to give this a try.  A couple of things... neither of are &#34;techies&#34; and were able to plug into our newer (less than 2 months old Samsung 65&#34; TV) in an instant.  So that was good.  If you turn it on it is an amazing sound upgrade from your TV sound system.  Very noticeable.  When you push the little conversation icon which is supposed to &#34;enhance&#34; the conversation portion of the sound, it is noticeable.  Perhaps not as dramatic, but it helps.  We are able to find a happy medium.  You are able to adjust the bass when you don't feel like having the &#34;theater&#34; experience.  It is a &#34;bar&#34; that sits just below our wall - hung TV.  It's about 30 or so inches long and about 3&#34; tall.  It does have the Bose logo right in the middle.  At first I wasn't thrilled about looking at it ... but I find I don't notice it now and it sort of helps to hide the cords - bonus.  As noted on other reviews... you do have to click on the &#34;conversation icon&#34; to &#34;enhance&#34; the conversation sound every single time you turn it on.  It would be nice if it just stayed on that position.  Also, it would NOT &#34;learn&#34; my new Samsung blue ray player or my TV... so the &#34;universal remote&#34; thing is not really happening.  The remote is very large and cumbersome for just turning on and off the sound bar...  I even researched the internet to be certain I had the right &#34;universal codes&#34; for my DVD player... Still didn't work.  So.... if you don't really care about adding just one more remote the sound quality is truly an upgrade from your TV. It really makes the sound match the quality of the picture I am seeing on my TV.  The conversation enhancement is noticeable, but maybe not as dramatic as you might hope - still - it's helpful.  We are definitely keeping it.  I never shy away from updating my reviews if new info would be helpful.  Further, I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews. When see you're buying Bose and the $200 price, you automatically think you're going to get a crystal clear, high quality sound from this soundbar. But you don't get that.<br /><br />What I got was sound that was not all that noticeably better than the speakers built into my new-model big-screen Vizio TV. Yes, I am connecting the TV to the Bose Soundbar using the optical cable. So disappointing.<br /><br />And, let's not forget that unnecessarily big remote control included. It's too big and uncomfortable to hold. I hate the remote control.<br /><br />Oh, and remember, there are no buttons whatsoever on the Bose Soundbar itself. If the remote ever breaks, or if it is lost, your Soundbar is useless without it.<br /><br />The build quality seems solid, but what good is that if the sound quality is so subpar? Considering the disappointing sound quality, this Bose Soundbar is way overpriced. Don't get me wrong, you can hear decent sound from the TV...it's just that since it isn't much better than what you can get from your newer HD TV, why bother? Now, if you have an older inferior TV with very low-watt speakers that produce tinny sound, the Bose Soundbar will make a bigger difference for sure. I had hoped this would work well with my new TV, I bought it because of the bluetooth feature. The bluetooth only works for pairing with phones to listen to music - it does NOT connect to your TV via bluetooth. The ironic part is that the connector that comes with it doesn't fit most TVs. Awesome. I had to go buy other parts to make it work. The GIGANTIC remote it comes with now only controls the volume and nothing else and my regular remotes will not work on the volume at all.",0.3333333333333333,2
B01CQOV3YO,8,3.625,2,6,"Initially I LOVED this speaker.  It was inexpensive and the sound was impressive for its size.  Pairing with my iPhone 7 was no problem and the battery lasts a long time.  My issue with this is that after a few weeks I started hearing a popping noise every now and then.  I checked to see if it was maybe my MP3 player but heard no popping sounds when I listened through headphones.  I hoped my speaker was just defective and I exchanged it but the new one still has the same popping noise.  It happens when using an MP3 connected via aux and while using Bluetooth as well.  So disappointed. I am very pleased with this speaker.  It holds a charge forever.  Has awesome sound and super easy to link up with my blue tooth.  I would definitely recommend it! This is an ok speaker, doesn't have much bass but it's god for my 13 year old who just wants to play music low in his room. Speaker freezes and skips. At first i thought it was the music apps i was using but it was the speaker! Ontop of that the sound quality is terrible and staticky! I returned this. I would not recommend.<br /><br />Update: company sent me a new complimentary speaker. It skips/freezes but not as much as the one I originally ordered. ok speaker. I dont have a lot of experience with bluetooth speakers, maybe it deserves 5 stars. Works perfectly, charge life excellent, sound is surprisingly good. Great size for portability, and plenty of heft for stability. Would buy sgain and again. From the moment I felt how heavy this little speaker was in the box I knew this was it was probably going to sound pretty good and I was right! It's AWESOME! It fills my entire living room and sounds great all the way to the master bedroom on the opposite side of my apartment. At first I was just looking for an upgraded speaker for my Echo Dot Mini and purchased the Oontz, which was $4 less. I was hating the sound quality of that one because it was a downgrade, not an improvement. Sounded tinny and irritating.  I was looking for a good little speaker for my small living room (not the pool area) and liked the controls on this speaker so to give it a try and boy was I impressed. This has a more balanced sound and decent bass. It's not super boomy bass, it's just right for my small space. This speaker paired instantly with my phone, computer and Alexa! The other speaker did not pair with Alexa at all. If you're on the fence about speakers under $30 I'll save you the trouble of wasting time and money by wholeheartedly recommending the Doss Touch.<br />----Update----<br />I purchased the the 20W Sounbox Pro, but later found out  it doesn't connect with this model for TWS. My attempt to add that speaker messed up the ability of my Doss Touch Sounbox to reconnect with Alexa. I emailed customer support and they contacted me within an hour and were incredibly helpful. They are replacing the speaker and told me I can keep the original one, which still connects to my phone's with bluetooth. I am so impressed by this company and this little speaker. Doss really stands behind their products! I'm listening to my favorite songs and they all have a weird sound quality. I'm no expert, but there seems to be little bass or high notes. My reference is a portable Bose speaker, which sounded great. Therefore, my expectations my be too high. This has so much power for such a small speaker! I'm throughly impressed by the amount of surround sound! Highly recommend this for anyone who want to turn up the volume from their music that's on their phone! This Bluetooth was super easy to connect, the speaker itself is user friendly! Definitely you should buy, wish I did a long time ago!",0.25,0
B01DFKC2SO,16,4.125,3,13,"Too fun - great speaker! I slipped mine inside a vintage radio.<br />It adds my shopping list to my iPhone and plays Jazz while I do housework. LOVE IT!! We have all three of the Echo products: The Dot, The Tap, and the original Echo. The Dot works very similarly to the original Echo. You say the wake word, you give a command or question, it responds. It does have a speaker itself, but it doesn't get as loud as the original Echo or the Tap. All of the devices will sync together in one Amazon app, but they all still work independently. Meaning, if I set an alarm on the Dot, only the alarm on the Dot goes off. But with the app on my phone, I can access all the devices in the one place. The Original Echo is better for larger areas. the Dot is ideal if you already have a sound system you would like to connect the Dot to, or small spaces like bathrooms or bedrooms. The Dot is great for kids. My daughter has it in her room so she can ask it how to spell words and such. The Tap is an entirely different beast, in my opinion. No wake word. Touch and talk. But it works via Bluetooth and wifi for on the go use using your cellular device. The Echo Dot does not come with a remote. Like the Original Echo, it needs to be plugged into the wall and needs wifi. (The Tap has a chargeable battery.) They are all great devices, though Amazon still has some work to be done on them. Each has a different place where it is the ideal choice, so which you should choose really depends on your needs. Very dumb due to bad programming.  Can't answer most of my questions.  Typical have to ask Google on my phone, which almost always knows.  Most of the skills you can load are bad and a waste of time.  Nice for music (although speaker not good.  Later models supposed to be better.) and controlling linked devices. I bought 6 of these when they were released with the bonus offer.  I got them for a move to a new home.  Because of the delay between receiving & setting up the units I missed the return window.  All 6 would have been shipped back for a refund.<br /><br />I have both The ECHO & TAP, love them both.  My primary very simple, not very technical use is as a  cooking & alarm timer & playing music.  The volume is far too low to hear the timer unless I'm in the kitchen.  My other units would blast me out of the house if I had the timer set on volume 10.  The DOT can not be heard in the next room with a simple wall & full door opening.  The microwave is louder.  I can't count on it as an alarm, reminder to take my meds or anything else.<br /><br />The quality of the sound for music is like an old AM radio.  Not worth listening to.  Yes, I know I can go buy extra speakers but it defeats the purpose of buying a small compact unit.  I am actually going to be giving them away & will give GOOGLE Home a try.  That's how disappointed I am in this AMAZON product.  AND, I love AMAZON so this doesn't sit well My AT&T/Direct TV salesman talked me into buying this worthless overpriced junk to somehow enable voice commands for my DirectTV remote (they are about the only tv service that has a remote without it).  Didn't work.  3 IT people in the family worked on it for over 2 hours just to get it connected to the Internet.  The only instructions I found on the Internet about using it to voice control my remote basically required ""hacking"" and reprogramming the Echo.  So gave up on that and cancelled by Direct TV service to go back to my old service that had voice commands and a wonderful search engine built right into the remote.  We did get it to stream music - and it sounded like a scratchy LP. So I have to buy expensive speakers for that? I'm out of table space for all of this and hate ugly cords running everywhere.  I'll just stick a CD in my DVD player or computer and listen to the music I want to listen to.  Siri on my iPhone has a better search engine.  It seems like every device you want to connect to (and I really don't want to connect it to anything - I simply don't care) costs more money for special equipment that will work with the Echo.  Spent HOURS of research on the internet trying figure out it's vague instructions.  The only time I need a smart anything is when I'm in my car and need directions - Siri does that quite well most of the time and I don't need to buy anything else.  In my home I have two computers, my iPhone and television.  All are pretty smart and keep me well informed on news and weather.  I have enough noise in my life - I don't need a device that just adds scratchy noise.  As far as music streaming Sirius is a huge waste of money so I stopped that service and decided my hundreds of CD's and/or an MP3 player can play all the music I want to hear.  I don't need any more complications in my life and I'm sick of trying to get devices to talk to each other - and the echo is the worst example of this. Another rare five-star review. I have the full size Echo which I got when they were offered fot $99 to Prime members only. I have preached the virtues and benefits of an Echo since the day I received it. I was finally able to talk my mom into a Dot the other day. Normally she's got her television blasting to help her sleep and I worried about the Dot's smaller speaker not being loud enough. It's been a week and though there's been some learning curve she hasn't once had the TV on and she's sleeping better. Extremely glad I was able to talk her into a Dot. It's loud enough for her, she's only had to skip a few songs that were too soft. I'm glad she got it and she loves it. I have had my main Echo since the first days after the initial invitation to buy was sent out. I absolutely love Alexa and use her for tons of things daily. - she lives in the hallway between the living room and kitchen where we  spend the most time. I added the Dot a month ago to bring the Alexa functions into our master bedroom.<br /><br />The Dot is as easy to use as the big Echo and now that the two can be connected, we have music throughout the house at the same time. I also like the intercom skill so we can talk to each other across the house quickly. My one dislike is the tinny sounding small speaker n the Dot. I've grown so accustomed to the balanced, clean sound from the big Echo that the Dot sound quality was a let down with music. However, reading me the news, ordering Starbucks, reading my audio books, working as an alarm clock or intercom is smooth and works just fine. I especially like being able to control our tv with Alexa voice commands - we cut the cable cord and stream via Prime, Netflix and Hulu Live and Alexa has made searching for a specific show much more simple. Its perfect for the bedroom. i use it as an alarm clock, and as a way to listen to my audiobooks before bed. Much nicer than blaring the echo in the livingroom. We have our Echo Dot set up in the bedroom. We also have a full sized Echo set up in our kitchen, which we got after the Dot (we wanted to test it out first). We use the Dot as an alarm clock, to play white noise while we sleep, music while we clean, and to check the weather and the news in the morning. The speaker on the Dot isn't as good as on the Echo, but honestly we didn't know what we were missing until we got the full sized Echo. :) It's perfect for a small room. My only complaint is that the Dot doesn't pick up my voice very well when the alarm is going off. It actually sometimes doesn't pick up my husband's either, but he has better luck. If I lower the tone of my voice, it seems to help. Overall though, we love it! I am SO glad I waited. All my friends have had Echo for long time, but I waited.  Not sure for what...just waited...then, Amazon came out with the Dot!  OMG!!  It is AWESOME!!!  My God-son gave me one for Christmas which arrived last week. Within a few days I ordered another one from Amazon.  Before its done, I'll probably have 4 of them in my home.  I LOVE the DOT!!!  AND pairing it with Bluetooth speakers means getting the exact sound I want.  Fantastic.  THANKS AMAZON!!! Device works great, but the speaker sucks ducks. Get the Zolo Halo instead. It sounds amazeballs right out of the box. Alas, Amazon keeps third-party devices from being able to use drop in and announcements, but otherwise, it's fantastic. I love this little thing. Speakers work great and my kid constantly asks it to play twinkle twinkle little star, Really enjoy the Echo.  I did buy the speaker which allows you to use the device using Bluetooth rather than having to plug it in.  Better volume and sound quality. Great for under $100. Already owned an Echo, but really did not like the lackluster sound when playing music.  So I bought a Dot (at Bed, Bath and Beyond) because the black units where on backorder at Amazon.com.  Hooked the unit up to a pair of Bose Companion 2 powered speakers via the 3.5 mm output jack on the Dot.  Really sounds so much better than the echo.  My only problem is that the output jack on the Dot is a little touchy, but once locked in everything is fine.  Not worth a trip to exchange.  I still use the echo in my bedroom.  I live in a small house, and only the unit closest to my location responds.  Very impressive..... Incredibly useful for all the reasons that you already know of, but it is great because I can connect my bluetooth streaming from say, my phone, to the Alexa, and the Alexa connects with a 1/8&#34; to RCA cable to my stereo for music. Great little device.  Our third Echo around the house.  Wasn't expecting it to have any speaker at all, but it has a passable little speaker in it - nothing to pump out the tunes, but certainly enough to provide feedback and even play some music at low volumes.",0.1875,4
B01DM6BDA4,3,2.3333333333333335,2,1,"PLEASE PLEASE, do not buy these cameras and the doorbell. I did not listen. Now I am not going to use a lot of big words to describe the problem. I am just going to tell you the truth. I am 70 years old and I purchased these cameras because I live alone and I wanted security. I am not secure and I do not feel secure. I purchased due to all the advertisements and because Shaq endorsed them. They do not work and the customer service really sucks. One day I was put on hold for 45 minutes then hung up on. The supervisors are no help at all. I purchased 3 floodlight cameras and 1 doorbell camera. They all are malfunctioning. The doorbell does not alert until the person is long gone. What is the purpose if the incident is over before you can even see it. Then you cannot even pull the incident up for about 4-5 minutes! You have to wait to see who was at your door and that's not safe. in 4-5 minutes someone could already be in your house!! I have horrible neighbors who are interfering with one of the floodlight cameras and literally making it go off every 1-3 minutes. I've called ring over 52 times since October of 2019. They cannot or will not resolve the issue, other than tell me the camera cannot be tampered with. I KNOW THAT IS NOT CORRECT! If you buy these cameras buy at your own risk. I am here to tell you that they do not work and customer service will not help you when they fail and they will fail!!!! Shame on you Shaq O' Neal. Shame on you Amazon for buying and selling this mess !!!!!!!  On my last recent call to Ring I was told that the cameras do not work in real time. The representatives say whatever they want to try and get you to hang up. I'm 70 not senile. Someone named Richmond told me that! The commercials show the people walking up, you activating the sound and talking to the person. One of My problems is the people are already gone before the camera actually activates. I would look into buying something else if I could afford it. You have a choice. DO NOT BUY RING. Do not be tricked like I was. The concept of being able to see who is at your door is great, but the Ring Doorbell Pro is not great.  When installing the product, the wire connectors would not accept and lock the wires, I had to purchase different wire connectors.  For the first three days, I kept losing power to the doorbell.  I would have to reinstall it, the wires won't stay connected tightly to the doorbell no matter how tightly the screws are.  I had to put a large amount of electrical tape to keep the screws from loosening and power being lost.<br />After that the doorbell worked as it should for approximately 3 weeks, it then started getting knocked offline and needed to be reset continually.  If it was my wi-connection it would make sense that my other gadgets would also be losing their wi-fi connection, but that wasn't the case.  3 weeks ago my video view feed was black, no audio no picture.  I reinstalled the doorbell, but it was a black screen view.  I would get the notice that someone was at the door, but I could view them.  I contacted the Ring customer service.  After several days they replied, had me run some wi-fi diagnostics and send them screen shots.  They said I needed a Ring Pro Chime, because I needed a wi-fi extender.  If it worked okay at the first, why all of a sudden would it not work now?  No response was received back customer service.  I have not received the Ring Pro Chime as I was told I would to correct the problem.  I had an electrician check my power voltage where the doorbell is installed, he said I have the correct voltage according to their instructions.  As of today my doorbell is dead, it doesn't rind, video doesn't even pull up any longer.  This is not a good product and I would not recommend it to anyone.  It has been a waste of time and money. install was surprisingly easy. everything is labelled and it comes with everything including drill bit. video is pretty good. still working to tweak motion settings so every neighborhood cat doesn't trigger it. audio is terrible and unusable.",0.6666666666666666,4

B01HTH3C8S,3,5.0,0,3,"So impressed with this tiny speaker! When fist turned on, the power and connect tones are clear and unique, not obnoxious, and upon connection the volume is usually much louder than expected. The sound coming from this little guy is HUGE and CLEAR! It would be too loud for comfort for me before it distorts, so I can’t even say whether it distorts at all. Fantastic sound! Recommended!! The best in its class has all functions that i was looking for such as bluetooth connection and sdcard plus aux and as a bonus fm radio which i rarely used. The most important thing i was looking on this was sound and this little speaker delivers i was amazed at how well the sound is balanced, love this new speaker and in future i plan to buy more anker products. Good bass, nothing too powerful, but waay better than a phone. Fits into your car cupholder, in large pants pockets, backpacks, etc. Never hand any problems with hooking it up bluetooth to my devices, though the other features admittedly confuse me a little... there's basically one button to switch modes? It's just me, but I don't use the other modes cuz I honestly don't understand how to get 'em going.",0.0,0

There is no jack on the speakers to connect earphones. There is no way to talk with the speakers in. I purchased these to boost the sound with my Echo Dot,  I was a bit disappointed because I can hear the static/background noise. However I tested it out on my iPad and speakers were pretty clear.  The lights are a cool feature and for the money it was a good buy. Obviously since these are Bluetooth there are wires to do it.

The adapter broke after a handful of uses 3 months after purchase.  The audio has severe distortion/feedback.  It is not the headphones, which work fine on an old iPhone.  There is no recourse since it's outside the return window. These are great at adapting my headphones, audio cords etc to my iPhone 7 Plus. New cords are extremely expensive.

B01LZV6TYQ,8,4.5,0,8,"I am so pleased with this speaker. I cannot believe the beautiful sound that comes from such a small speaker. First off, I am not an audiophile. This is a review from a simple person who wanted music at work.<br /><br />I am a Rural Carrier for the United Stated Postal Service. I deliver mail in an LLV truck and these vehicles are basically mobile tin cans. Every panel rattles, making for quite an unpleasant environment, audio wise. I tried playing music directly off my phone, but alas my speakerphone is only so loud and is constantly drowned out by the LLV.<br /><br />So, I researched Bluetooth speakers and, based on the reviews and popularity, recently purchased two:<br />-[[ASIN:B016XTADG2 Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker with 24-Hour Playtime, 66-Foot Bluetooth Range &amp; Built-in Mic, Dual-Driver Portable Wireless Speaker with Low Harmonic Distortion and Superior Sound - Black]]<br />-[[ASIN:B01LZV6TYQ OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Splashproof Bluetooth Speaker - Designed &amp; Engineered by Cambridge SoundWorks for Richer Bass, HD Sound, and 30-Hour Playtime, 10W+ Power, Water Resistant, Portable Wireless Speaker]]<br /><br />The Anker SoundCore is being returned while I am keeping the OontZ Angle 3 Plus and here is why.<br /><br />I tested both speakers in my home at first. My very first impression, out of the box:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus -  was nice to touch and just felt solid and very well built.<br />Anker SoundCore - just felt like a simple lightweight brick. It really didn't give the impression of longevity or durability.<br /><br />The set-up guides were quite different from each other.<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - Extremely easy to read, follow and understand (remember, I am not a music nut lol. This was my first time ever using a Bluetooth speaker and was in completely uncharted territory.) It was all in English, and only English and the diagrams were detailed and made the entire set-up process seamless and carefree.<br />Anker SoundCore - This guide was very hard to follow. It is printed in darn near every language, in tiny print and the diagrams were quite small as well. I ultimately did get the speaker paired with my phone and figured out what buttons did what, but it took nearly 15 minutes to do so.<br /><br />Bluetooth Pairing<br />With both speakers and my phone lined up on a table (well within the proximity specified in each set-up guide), both speakers paired, however:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - MUCH faster in pairing (mere seconds!).<br />Anker SoundCore - took nearly two minutes to complete the pairing process.<br /><br />Pause/Play Button<br />Since I dismount to deliver packages to a customer's door routinely on my route, I really need to have a simply way to pause my music. I really like how both speakers offer this function on directly on the units, saving me from having to handle my phone.<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - I barely press the Play/Pause button and the speaker immediately reacts. There is NO hesitation.<br />Anker SoundCore - I press the Play/Pause button and there is a delay of about 5 seconds.. just long enough to make me think I didn't press hard enough and reach to do it again only for the speaker to finally react.<br /><br />Volume/Overall Playback Quality<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - Wow. Just wow. It is truly unbelievable to hear such full sound, and bass(!), coming from such a small unit. I found myself perfectly pleased with the output without ever reaching max volume on the speaker itself. So I am looking forward to how well it will work in my LLV during my first road test. As for now, I am thoroughly impressed!<br />Anker SoundCore - I maxed out the volume on my phone and the speaker and was just not impressed. If I could guess, I'd say the max output this speaker achieved was only about 25% more than my speakerphone alone (while the OontZ Angle 3 Plus blew it out of the water with close to double, if not more, output than my speakerphone alone).<br />I also noted some kind of distortion or interference type background sound with the Anker SoundCore at mid volume and above.<br /><br />Speakerphone/Mic<br />I was able to answer an incoming phone call on both units as described in each set-up guide. The quality of in-call sound on each speaker differed:<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - My husband's (the caller) voice was crisp and clear, as if he was sitting talking right next to me. There was no distortion or feedback out of the speaker. Husband reported nothing but a clear voice on his phone.<br />Anker SoundCore - Husband's voice was clear, but echoed horribly. No matter what volume level I used. There was no distortion (I was expecting this given the distortion with the music playback) bu the continuous echoing is a major issue for me. Husband reported a slight &quot;faded&quot; type of echo on his phone.<br /><br />Road Test (in my LLV)<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - The sound is amazing in the truck! Thinking I would need it, I maxed the volume on both the speaker and my phone then pressed play on my music. Well, I certainly don't need max volume. I reduced the volume on both the speaker and my phone and found a very happy medium output. This speaker performs perfectly in the loud, rattling setting of a USPS LLV.. even while bouncing down rural dirt two tracks and washboard gravel roads. I am extremely pleased with this tiny speaker.<br />Anker Soundcore - Even with maxed volume settings, I could not get this speaker to perform anywhere near as well as the OontZ Angle 3 Plus. It had volume and was loud enough to hear over the vehicle's own noise, however the distortion/interference mentioned earlier was still present and in the truck during the road test it had what I would describe as an echoing effect on the music, specifically the singers' voices. It just wasn't clear. (I hope that makes sense.)<br /><br />Battery Life/Listen While Charging<br />OontZ Angle 3 Plus - So far, the battery life is impressive. After receiving it, I charged it overnight (as recommended). I then had it connected to my phone for about an hour of home testing. Turned it off and I next used it at work on a Saturday.. had it powered on and connected to my phone and actively playing music for about 5.5 hours. I then used it again on Monday (much longer and busier days in the USPS, FYI).. had it on, connected and active continuously for nearly 9 hours. I have yet to see the low battery light come on. I plan to see just how many days of work I can get out of a single charge.<br />Anker Soundcore - I have no information for this section on this speaker since I am returning it.<br /><br />Exterior/Cleaning<br />At first, I had the OontZ Angle 3 Plus setting on the dashboard of the LLV. This didn't last more than two stops. Despite having the four rubber &quot;feet&quot;, the speaker still slid around causing more of a distraction than I would like. I ended up setting it on top of my personal bag, in a bin by my feet with the speaker facing up. This move really helped my piece of mind, knowing it will not go anywhere. This speaker has a soft rubber exterior. It is quite nice and feels luxurious, however... this exterior attracts all dust particles within 50 feet! USPS LLVs are *not* known for being the cleanest and even though I moved the speaker from the dust-ridden dashboard to a bin, it was still slathered with dust and dirt by the end of my route. I figured it was a fair trade, sacrificing the appearance for the gain of having decent music. But.. I got home and went to clean it. I will tell you, my expectations of this working were very low. I didn't think the dust would come off that supple rubber. But with a wet paper towel and a few slow wipes, it did. So, it can be cleaned up!<br /><br />Case<br />I did purchase the case for this speaker ([[ASIN:B01NBDY6VP [Official] OontZ Angle 3 Plus Bluetooth Portable Speaker Carry Case, Neoprene with Aluminum Carabiner, reinforced zipper, by Cambridge SoundWorks [NOT FOR OontZ Angle 3]]]). I was mainly wanting a safe way to transport and store the speaker, but after reading the other reviews I was hoping I would be able to keep it clean in the case and still enjoy my music on my route. I received the case and used it yesterday. The case is extremely nice and I appreciate the interior mesh pocket. I have no need for it now, but I'm sure it will come in handy if I ever take this speaker on vacation and need to take the charging cables along. As for playback while in the case? Yeah, it was terribly muffled. It didn't work for me as it apparently has for others. Yet, the case itself is exactly what I was wanting for taking it to and from work. It is not as thickly padded as I would have expected, however it does protect the speaker.<br /><br />Overall, for my specific purpose and intended use for a Bluetooth speaker, the Anker SoundCore simply won't cut it. However, it is still a nice speaker and will perhaps fit your needs perfectly. After all, most people don't drive LLVs and have the same high demands that go along with that. For me, the OontZ Angle 3 Plus is what I'll be bopping down the road to, mailbox to mailbox.<br /><br />Happy hunting! Hope this review helps you out! The speaker is a good quality, but it lacks the depth of sound I prefer.  For the money, it is okay.  I would have definitely spent more for better sound and probably in the future. Great little speaker.  Can't speak to music quality but I read a ton of audiobooks, so this is great to carry around the house so I can &#34;read&#34; while doing chores & such.  Never had any issues after several months of use, plus the battery lasts a long time (never measured, but it's never died on me...I just charge it now & then when I think about it).  Highly recommend esp for audiobooks. The OontZ Angle 3 PLUS speaker has incredible battery life, pretty good bass, somewhat muddy mid range and okay highs (if you use the right app with a good equalizer). I found playing straight from the phone's built in apps wasn't so great but I downloaded another app with powerful settings and controls that bring out the best of this speaker. The OontZ Angle 3 PLUS has two speakers and 10 watts of power. There's a passive bass radiator. I never really thought those added much. All in all it's a decent speaker that kicks up my shower and shaving time. I got this on a Lightning Deal for a nice discount. I would not pay the full asking price. This is my second OontZ Angle.  I like it and it pairs really well with my Kindle Fire, laptop, Bluetooth headphones, etc., however, the volume buttons are really difficult to operate.  If you hold them down with steady pressure, they freeze.  So you have to repeatedly press the buttons to increase or decrease the volume in increments.  My first OontZ (not a 3 plus) does not have that limitation on the volume--in general, it is just easier to use when you want to quickly adjust the volume. I actually use this as my PC speaker (when I am not using it on adventures) as it fits neatly onto the base of my 27&#34; BenQ monitor.<br /><br />Does not have ANY annoying &#34;features&#34; like most other Bluetooth speakers do, such as beep prompts and creepy voices that tell you the status of your speaker, when you are trying to listen to music. Instead of that crap, it has an extremely useful auto-shutoff feature.  As a result, I hardly ever have to charge this thing.  It is smart enough to shut off when you are not using it, and stay on when you are!<br /><br />I initially purchased the Angle 2, and while I did like it, my audio snobbery forced me to keep looking.  I purchased the 3, and have not looked back.  Sounds great with any type of music I have thrown at it.  Ruggedly built, and aesthetically pleasing to boot! Got this in a lightning deal for $20. Works as good as my JBL Bluetooth speaker at a fraction of the cost.",0.0,0

So as others have noted, there may be a issue of disconnection propensity for this device.  Seems to be solvable by pushing the manual on/off toggle button on the plug.  But of course if your Wifi internet connection goes down, it won't be able to change its on/off state.  It is a good sample of the potential pros and cons you might encounter with a broader smarthome configuration.  👏👏 Love the smart plug automation.

Initially I wanted to connect to my coffee pot. But the plug came on and off but the coffee pot did not turn on. So I settled for a lamp. put it on a lamp But really only one outlet can't do much but use it for a lamp. I do like it and got it on Prime day for a very good price.

B06XCM9LJ4,5,4.6,0,5,"Love this Echo. Great speaker add on. Calendar reminder has helped to remind me of appts or things last minute. I definitely recommend Overall the Echo is decent (hence my 3 out of 5 stars), but it is smaller than I was expecting.  Sound quality is good for the speaker being small.  I'd recommend a much larger speaker for the next generation of Echo. The echo is great, and Alexa is great. I only wish that the volume ring was back in this version... I miss it from the first generation echo. In comparing the sound fro the first-generation echo, I can't tell much of a difference. The sound is better on my Google Home. On the Echo, sound is a bit flat to my ears. The Microphone picks up very well though, as good or better than my Google home, and the first-generation echo.

B06XCQKTKR,3,5.0,0,3,"Really an excellent speaker which can be used anywhere. My college-age son loved it. The sound quality is excellent. I have gone through many Bluetooth speakers and had yet to listen to one that had such depth of sound as this Bose SoundLink Revolve.  I know it's not the first Bose SoundLink Bluetooth speaker, but it's my first and it blows away all the others that gather dust around here.  Visually similar to my Amazon Echo, I had to let Alexa know that she has a competitor in my home but reassured her that she is still loved.  I can't talk to this Bose, but each time I turn it on, a generated female voice alerts me to the battery life remaining and what device it's pairing with.  Setup took only a minute, the manual is only a few words and diagrams, and after a full battery charge, it's still going after daily use for what seems like dozens of hours.  I'm serious, I have not plugged it back in yet because I want to see what happens when the battery nears death.  I did not want to wait to write this review because I'm so impressed with the audio that is generated from this little speaker that can also withstand being carried outside without harm.  Of course, I'm not willing to test it in the rain, but have to say that my neighbors could not believe the music was coming from this little black speaker. Today was like Christmas for me. I received a package and iIn the box, is a very sleek speaker. As you unpack this little 2 pound wonder, you find the charging cord and charger and instructions. First thing I did, was plug this baby into an outlet and start charging it up. Before you use it, download the Bose Connect app for iPhone or android app, which will unlock the pairing feature and access future updates. You will see the charge on the speaker on the very top by the on off button. On the top of the speaker, you will see a Bluetooth pairing button and symbols to show if it is connected or not. One charge will yield about 12 hours of play time. On the top, you will see the speaker also has NFC capability. You will also see buttons for volume. The sound is what you would expect from Bose. Loud, clear and lots of bass. Oh, one more thing, the speaker is water resistant so you can have it outside. This was very easy connect to my iPhone.",0.0,0
B073BVWRSP,4,4.75,0,4,"I use this to play music while I'm riding my bike to work everyday so I have it turned up full blast the whole way.  It takes full volume without distortion but I wish it could pump out a bit more bass (has a slight rattle when the speakers bottom out).<br /><br />Still, for the price and against competing portable speakers it gets LOUD and pairs seamlessly with my phone.  I get a week's worth of riding out of a charge, so that's roughly 12 hours of full volume playing without dying on me.  Pretty good.  I like this speaker, it sounds good, it plays loud and since I use it 12 hours a week I generally get a year or two out of it before it breaks.  For the amount of use I put it through that's pretty good for the price, I'm sure it will last you far longer since I used mine so often. These are excellent for increasing both the range and volume of wireless (and wired) devices. Give your phone stereo sound with real separation and no complex control interface. Let the audio from your in-car DVD player be easily heard in the back seat and almost inaudible up front. Add in their water resistance and these are the perfect indoor/outdoor audio solution. I also have the JBL Charge2 bluetooth speaker. The JBL has incredible sound, and great bass. This little OontZ Angle 3 ULTRA Is just as clear as the JBL. Bass is almost as good but its up there. For the price I highly recommend this speaker! Fantastic little package and has GREAT volume and the battery last all day for me. I use it for work in a shop where we work on vehicles. Loud little thing I will tell you. Never loses quality either. For a portable bluetooth speakers, these are excellent in sound quality,  battery life and well designed.  Dont expect high quality bass sound",0.0,0

It was working great for the first few months...then I started noticing the battery would be dead the next day after a full recharge. Definitely not worth the $$$$, my cheap $20 earbuds were much more reliable. I found Bose's latest wireless headphones to be a fairly serious disappointment, which was surprising and frustrating after having bought 5 or 6 pairs of headphones over the years, along with speakers and a Wave Radio.  I *like* Bose products.<br /><br />Let me start with the positive, to be fair.<br /><br />1. They sound great.<br />2. They stay in my ears.  (A feature Apple did not think to include with their glorious AirPods.)<br />3. The Bose connect app on the iPhone is slick and useful.<br /><br />The negatives.<br /><br />1. They are very big and jut from my ears in a way that looks comical.  I've seen other people compare them to the bolts on Frankenstein's neck, but for the ears.  Actually, though, it's worse than that, because their weight makes them droop.  So I'd describe the look as more Frankenstein Eeyore.  If you have hair that covers your ears, you will probably be ok.  But I am close to bald, so I can't really wear them in public.  Since I bought them to wear during my workouts at LA Fitness and while coding at work, the fact that they make me look silly is a show stopper.<br /><br />2. Given the look issues, I'd love to wear them when I listen to music on my computer at home, but they don't pair properly with Windows 10.  They have a voice profile and a music profile.  No matter how I fiddle with my PC, based on advice from the various threads on Bose's support forums, I cannot get the music profile to activate.  The reason this is a problem is that the voice profile only plays music in one ear, and at far reduced quality.  Like it's-being-piped-to-your-ear-through-Satan's-toilet quality.  Bose's suppport forums have various threads about this, and it's clear that some part of Bose's software group either doesn't get it or is trying to avoid publicly stating that they can't fix the problem.  They claim it is Windows or software differences on various PCs, but my Apple AirPods work fine as do Bose's SoundSport Wireless headphones (though they lack a mic, so the scenario is somewhat different).<br /><br />3. I wish there was a way to hear audio in both ears while making calls.  You can do this with the AirPods.",0.6666666666666666,3
B0748N1BZD,4,5.0,0,4,"I have had one of these speakers for a year now and I use it nearly every day!  It is perfect for listening to music in the shower; no more straining to hear the phone on max volume!<br /><br />I brought it with me to a holiday lunch meeting at work in one of our event spaces and one of my bosses was so surprised that it wasn’t the speakers in the space that he bought one.  Other co workers that weren’t there reached out to me to tell me they bought one because of my boss’s speaker and story about mine.  Very odd, but it seems that people decide that they may actually need a speaker after seeing this one.<br /><br />This speaker, while being hefty in the hand (I’d say it weighs about a pound), is super packable.  It’s durability leaves me unconcerned when I toss it in my carryon bag for work trips or visits to far away family.  It is certainly a luxury, but also fun to pull out and toss on the patio at a family gathering.<br /><br />I just picked up a second speaker (yay for holiday sales).  I like party mode and the fact that you could use 2 for stereo audio if you are so inclined.  I did note that the audio was oddly out of sync when I first tried it, but repairing seemed to resolve it.<br /><br />I recommend to anyone in the market for a Bluetooth speaker, but admit it is more of a luxury item. Couldn’t believe a small speaker can produce such a good quality sound. I use it in my car, at work and everywhere I go, well worth the money. Awesome speaker! Typical Bose Quality with low price! Easy to take to Beach, Vaca or home. Got to say, I love the Bose Bluetooth speakers. Portable, great sound and small. You can take them just about anyplace. Pair it with your phone or iPod and you will have sound in no time. And it will be good sound. Not tinny like with other portables. You get long lasting power too. Charge and go. For hours.

B074WDWVX1,3,5.0,0,3,"My daughter has an older, iPhone 6. The headphone jack on her phone broke several months ago, so she has not been able to listen to music using headphones for a while. We got an estimate for repairing it, but she doesn't want to spend the money on it.  I saw this and wondered if it would help solve that problem for her. Since it uses a lightening cable, we thought we would give it a try. It works wonderfully with her phone. She is very happy to be able to listen to music again without the use of a portable speaker. She is also able to charge her device at the same time. The sound quality is good and there has been no hissing or feedback. it took me a while to find these. I did searches and it wasn't until my husband came across this. I do have bluetooth B&O headphones but they only last for 4 hours. So I use my Westones to listen to my meditation music or my Apple playlist alone. I love that Apple allowed a company to make this because I spent a lot of money on westones for best quality listening. AND I love the ability to charge my phone at the same time. so this little thing is worth the money!<br /><br />Now I know many other companies make a similar thing but I ran into the problem of not compatability and I spend money on 3 different ones. so yes, these Belkins ARE the bomb!

With the low price of this speaker, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but some sound was better than none, I figured. The sound this little speaker puts off, taken into consideration with the cost, blew my mind! I had to kick the volume WAY down & it was still louder than my prior computer's built in speakers. I was really shocked. I love it!! I'd definitely recommend this to others & I'll probably buy another one for the house! My tiny phone speaker was louder. The speaker is truly plug and play, Sound is fine. Volume is controlled by the PC sound settings. I wish it had an LED or some indicator that it’s on. I went to use it for a video call recently and I didn’t find out it wasn’t working until the call, which meant I had to do something different for that call.

B07644ZS1D,3,2.6666666666666665,1,2,"Without researching the product I did an impulse buy of the Samsung Gear IconX.  I liked the idea that I could load music and use them while I was fishing.  During their use, the left earbud was on the side facing the sun.  After about a half hour, the earbud started announcing something like ""need to cool down"".  It would repeat it  . . . and repeat it . . . and repeat it until I took the earbuds off and put them back in their case and in my vehicle.  The touch controls are crazy and unpredictable and I am never sure what will happen when I try to do a tap or double tap . . .  I will be attempting to return the earbuds for a refund. These are rather pricey for what they do, which is cord free earphones/buds. The case which holds and charges them (with a USB cord) is rather nice and handy, and lights up (red or green) to let you know when they're charged. They also charge relatively fast, which is good, and have various molds to help ensure a good fit. But yes, you'll be charging these a lot if you use these daily or often, be forewarned. Also, the controls are a little tricky to figure out and you might fumble with them a bit, considering you're pressing the things, basically, no nice cord with clear buttons. The sound quality is decent, not quite what I'd expect for the price, since part of the price is for the cordless nature of these things (that and the internal storage and the google speak and...). So yes, they've got a lot of nice options to them which make them more than just earbuds. My first pair, one of the earbuds the sound got really low, nothing worked to fix it. Returned for replacement.<br />Second pair, after a couple of months the same thing happened, but now they are out of warranty and I cannot replace them. I did not pay $200 for 1.5 years of use, this is BS. never again, will buy Airpods as much as I dislike Apple.. Reading online it looks like this is very common.<br /><br />Edit: Added one star back, just tried using them again after 4 months and they are working again! Also, I deleted the app and reinstalled it, including the earbuds plugin. Make sure to delete the app completely by going through all the apps installed. Wait about two weeks and reinstall the app. This is what I did, might work for you.

B077378YSS,3,4.333333333333333,0,3,"I love the bass level output.  Very clear and clean.  It was super easy to synchronize with iPad, android phone.  The controls are great and so easy to use, better than those that sit on the ear piece.  The only thing is that the microphone is sensitive and needs to be near the mouth to be heard at the other end.  The design and Quality of material is pretty great.  Aside from the microphone, this is my favorite wireless earbuds. We blow through ear buds in our house and it seems that everyone has different ones that they like and don't like.  Let's see how these measure up:<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE EAR BUDS LIKE?<br />These ear buds come in a nice box with a little instruction booklet.  There is a little bag with three sets of gel caps in it.  There are also three sets of hooks.  Each of them comes in small medium and large.  The hooks keep the buds in the ear but are soft so they don't hurt the ear at all.<br /><br />The controls are on the right ear- the top hits about where the chin is.  The connecting cord is big enough to be worn in front or back.  The set comes with a cord but you have to have your own USB access to plug it into whether it be on an outlet or computer.<br /><br />COMFORT<br />One of the most comfortable and secure earbud/headsets we have used to date- love that the hooks that help hold them in are soft so they don't hurt the ear, even after worn for a while.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br />VOLUME<br />The headset gets the best result for us with the volume on max on the headset and halfway on the tablet that we use it with.<br /><br />HIGHS/LOWS/MIDS<br />One of the things with this headset is that the highs are really nice and strong and so are the lows.  The problem seems to be that the mids are drowned out making it feel like it is a bit out of balance.  We have messed with it quite a bit and it seems to be the way it is.<br /><br />SOUND PROOFING<br />These have excellent sound insulation capabilities.  That does mean, however, that you need to be careful where you are wearing them if you need to hear what is around you or not.<br /><br />BATTERY ALERT<br />When you first turn on the headphones, it will identify itself, tell you it is pairing and then give you an idea of how much battery life you have left- low, medium, or high.<br /><br />POWER BUTTON<br />The power button is nice.  Volume/skip functions are a challenge to get used to as compared to other Bluetooth headsets.  There are sequences and timing as compared to others which seem to be simpler to use.<br /><br />PAIRING<br />Very good pairing on all of the different devices we tested this with- several phones from Moto G3, Blu phone, Samsung Tablets and our stereo (forgot brand)<br /><br />CHARGE<br />A charge has been lasting a good six to eight hours for us.  Recharging seems to take us about three hours.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />These are comfortable headphones that are easy to use, stay in the ears well, and have good insulation from ambient noise in the room or surroundings.  They have nice highs and lows but tend to drown out the mids.  The controls are a bit more challenging to learn at first as compared to other Bluetooth head sets we have used.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR AND A HALF STARS- not able to give that so I am doing four.  It is more like four and a half.  The sound could be a little more balanced, and the controls not quite so difficult, but this is still a great set of headphones and we like it a lot. I have been through many Bluetooth buds. The problem I have, most of the time, is getting a good fit in my ear. I also detest that separate charging port that you have to attach to a usb cord, to a port and attach the earplugs. This one does not do that. The charging port is on the power/volume piece, so that is one less thing to have to worry about losing. I was able to easily pair my iPhone and the sound was good. I am not a musician, so I don't require the loud bass that others want. I listed to podcasts as I sleep. These are working just fine and I am not getting tangled up with the speaker input like in regular ear plugs. I am a happy customer right now. The only things I would change at this moment is the length of battery power. It is 9 hours of extended. I would like a full 12 hours of power.",0.0,3
B0778PCW73,5,4.4,0,5,"Value pair of cans. Good for kids that continue to find new ways of breaking every pair that of headphones they are given. Easy to connect to and have a decent sound for YouTube and movies. They fall a bit short for music. Cool style for an elementary kid. The mic works well for FaceTime or google hangouts. These headphones charged well and I really thought the sound is great. The charged stayed for several hours and they were comfortable to wear. I like the night green color too!  The Bluetooth connected easily to my phone. I really like these headphones, especially for this price.  I have $400 Sennheisers and after listening to these for a while I had to swap out to see what the sound difference was.  And I definitely cannot say that these are just as good, but I cannot say that the difference would justify an additional $300+.  Especially when I was looking for a pair for my kids to use on road trips.<br /><br />The kids did appreciate them.  They are not completely isolating but they isolated enough to let them listen to their music over road noise while driving.  They will definitely be a part of our road trip equipment from now on.<br /><br />The fit seems to be better for the kids than for me.  Perhaps my head is too big, but they felt a bit tight for me.  Kids report they fit great.  I'm not sure that an audiophile would really appreciate these, but for the price, my kids love them. I normally think of storage media and batteries when I think of Maxell. That said, this is my second pair of Maxell headphones. My first pair is an ANC set that isn’t perfect, but they’re far and away better than I would ever have expected. These phones are not ANC phones, they’re just wireless listening phones. I was hopeful that they would be as good as my ANC phones in terms of sound quality, and Maxell has not disappointed me. They’re not perfect but they’re better than you can reasonably expect from the asking price.<br /><br />Up front, let me say that I am not a big fan of on-ear headphones, and these fall into that category. I prefer an over-the-ear phone which to me is more comfortable. These aren’t bad for on-ear phones. This comes down to preference. If you are cool with on-ear phones, these will work for you, but if you have to have over-ear phones then you should consider other options.<br /><br />The pads are soft enough, though they aren’t super cushy like some others I have used.<br /><br />Being Bluetooth phones I immediately connected them to my phone. The connection went off without a hitch, though the phone was slower to find these than I had hoped. Once connected, they have been stable and reconnecting is much faster.<br /><br />The real test is the sound profile. On my ANC phones, Maxell worked a miracle and got the sound profile nearly perfect even when the noise canceling is turned on. With these phones, the sound profile is not precise but it’s very balanced and better than average. The bass is strong but not throbbing like most headphones made these days. I like bass, but I don’t appreciate the insistence on pumping it so heavily that it gives me a headache. The midrange is full and music sounds like it has some depth without sounding like it’s playing from the bottom of a well. The highs are bright and clear, though on specific frequency ranges there is the slightest hint of distortion if you really look for it (and since I’m reviewing these, I went looking for it).<br /><br />I cranked up the music as high as I could, and there was only a hint of distortion in the highs. And I had a headache when I was done.<br /><br />Build-wise, these are not too bad. I would not pack them in a gym bag or anything like that, but these should work fine for a long while as long as they’re cared for properly. There’s enough flex in them to make them durable enough to survive some rough handling, but at the end of the day they’re primarily plastic - a drop from the right height or being crushed in a book bag will break them.<br /><br />These phones are under $50 as I write this. What’s really distressing is that I have phones that are north of $200 that do not sound as good as these. Maxell knows how to make a good headphone that competes well with more expensive phones - I have two very different pairs to prove it. It begs the question - why are they only making budget headphones?<br /><br />I would rate these slightly lower if the asking price were above the $50 mark. But, at the asking price you’d be hard-pressed to find headphones that sound better. The headphones themselves are comfortable and easily adjustable, the range is nice, and the sound quality is great, but the controls themselves are frustrating. The pairing says that you hold until the light flashes blue then red, and I did this. But what happened to me is I held it and it flashed blue once then it would flash red repeatedly. The manual said nothing about repeated red flashing so I assumed it was in pairing mode and I was confused as to why it wouldn't appear on my phone. After a while, I realized that if I held the pairing button longer after it started flashing red then it would flash blue and red alternately and then I could pair. I still have no clue what the red flashing means. Also, the way the skip/volume is set up is weird and temperamental. You hold the button to change the volume and press once to skip or go to the previous song (depending on which volume buttons you press), but sometimes after letting go from holding the volume button the song will change anyway. I think it would be more efficient to switch to press to change volume and hold to change song to prevent accidental switches. I have yet to try a phone call but if the volume/song switch buttons weren't so annoying this would be a great product.",0.0,3
B0791H74NT,10,4.9,0,10,"I got these for my mother when her (battery operated) speakers finally croaked.  She had to come get me and show me how good they sounded.  I was pleasantly surprised. These look nice and give off surprisingly good sound,  I work with my laptop constantly and use it for everything, but their built in speakers are terrible.  These are nice an portable and plug and play, would recommend for anyone who travels or moves around with their laptop a lot These speakers take up less space.  The sound though!!  I wasn't expecting much from such a little speaker, but to my surprise, they sound great and can get pretty loud!! My sound system on my work pc isn’t the best. Internal speakers are often not the best quality- you need an external speaker set if you want the enjoy better overall sound. This need convinced me to add Creative Pebble 2.0 USB-Powered Desktop Speakers to my office.<br /><br />These speakers are round and are angled at approximately 45 degrees. This is good, because it aims the sound more directly at you, when you’re sitting at a desk. The sound quality is generally good, especially for this price range. There is a volume control on one of the speakers, which controls both. If you feel you can’t get the desired volume, don’t forget to check your existing volume, on your pc. The control on these speakers works with your built- in speakers volume control.<br /><br />I really like the bass delivered by these speakers. When you consider how small these speakers are, it is not something you would expect. Oh, and speaking of the size, they are small enough to fit into tight quarters. They are less then five inches wide, so you should have no problem finding a place on your desktop to sit them.<br /><br />These speakers come in either white or black, to fit your décor. I picked black because it matches best with my color scheme. II like what I have and, again, for the price point it would be difficult to find a set of speakers any better than Creative Pebble 2.0 USB Powered Desktop Speakers. They are easily worth the small investment. I needed something to listen to audio books and youtube videos on.These are very nice for that. I thought the tilt was really silly, but it seems to help a lot with the sound.Who knew? Plenty loud, I have hearing issues and these are fine. Set up was straight forward and super easy. Its a lot of speaker for a little price Love these external speakers. I got them because I do gaming, and sometimes I just don’t want to wear my headphones. They do everything I expected them to do and more If your desktop didnt come with speakers, well let me tell you this is the product for you! The sound quality is great! It doesn't take up too much room to setup and it isn't complicated to setup. Once plugged in just make sure the computer knows those are the speakers and its done!!!! These little speakers are GREAT! They work great for me, would definitely recommend them for ppl like me who don’t want to spend a lot of money. These are perfect for that. The noise quality is great, the bass is great, but I only use them at quiet levels, as my boss is kind of a jerk about this kind of thing... I love these for a good looking, smallish size, good sound quality desk speakers.<br />I have always trusted Creative for anything music related. PROS:<br />NICE SOUND!  Would these compete with REALLY high end speakers? No, but for little desktop speakers, they're GREAT!  BETTER than ones that cost more.<br /><br />LOOK - I like the look of them on my computer table and the fact they come in black or white.  I got the black.  Much cooler looking than  most little speakers.<br /><br />EASE OF USE AND INSTALLATION - OK I AM SO NOT HI TECH!  UNDERSTATEMENT.  These are easy to attach to my old desktop and simpler than previous ones I had with more cords.  ALSO USE couldn't be easier.  When power is connected, green light goes on.  There is one simple knob to turn on and same knob adjusts volume.<br /><br />PRICE - THESE ARE BETTER SOUND QUALITY, LOOK HIGHER END AND BETTER than more expensive desktop speakers I've had that cost more.<br /><br />IF THERE IS ONE DOWNSIDE, these would not be speakers you would want to travel with a lot.  They look great, but the center part has no protection and is soft.  FINE for sitting on top of a desk or table, but you would have to pack carefully because something sharp or hard pushing into them would ruin them.

B0791T9CV7,3,2.3333333333333335,2,1,"I've been trying to use the cube with DTVNow for a few months now and have reset to factory defaults, deinstalled app multiple times and still have the same issue, which is the video and audio will stutter when starting the app after being dormant overnight or idle for several hours.  If I restart the Fire Cube, the app will work ok.  It's never been as fast the Gen 2 FireTV box we had but I was willing to deal with that for the slick device control the Cube offered. Not being able to use my primary  TV streaming service is a show stopper. Shame as it could have been a great device, I suspect it's a processor and/or lack of memory issue, but not certain. Will be selling it CHEAP and replacing with with a ROKU or Invidia Shield. I literally hate my fire cube. I have 9 fire sticks in my house of 11 TVs and my fire cube is worthless.

B0791TX5P5,3,3.6666666666666665,1,2,"It's works perfect. I just press microphone and say what i want to watch. Helps!! I got the newest 4K streaming stick with alexa voice control remote. As of yet i haven't purchased a 4K T.V. but the firestick works on any high def T.V. with a hdmi port. There are lots of free movie and T.V. apps so you can cut the cord and save lots of $$ doing away with cable. You will just have to simply connect a OTA antenna to the back of your TV to receive your local channels. The remote is ok but not great. It does sync easily with your T.V.s CEC control and lets you use the remote for T.V. power on and off. Volume control and alexa voice command. But personally i found it just as quick and easy to manually navigate the apps you want to watch rather than using the button on the remote to ask for a certain app. More times than not the voice control will get what your asking it wrong. But the volume control and power control on the remote is a very good plus over the basic remote. The battery compartment for remote is a little tricky to get opened at first but if you just apply a slight pressure at the same time as sliding the compartment down jt will slide right open. And getting to the streaming quality it will depend on which app you are using. Surprising to me is that the Amazon Prime Video app uses a lot more wifi data than most of the other apps making the shows and movies buffer quite a bit sometimes. I am curious why Amazon Prime uses so much more data vs Netflix or Hulu for example but it surely does. And if you have a Roku device and are used to the Rokus functions it will take a bit of getting used to how the Firestick apps are downloaded and stored compared to the Roku. But they both have equally good and bad comparisons when it comes to their individual functions. Both have excellent picture and sound. What i would really like is for Amazon's firestick to have a remote control app for your android or ios phone. Roku does have the free remote app to download and works great navigating and also has alexa voice control and tou can plug earphones into your phone for private listening. And also remember when buying a firestick to check the gift box if it is going to be used by someone else in their home. If you check the connect to my account box instead all of your information on your other firesticks will be on the new one and also the Amazon buying app with your personal information. So be vigilante and at least have a PIN set up on your Amazon account so no non approved purchases can be made. Not happy with my ""upgrade"" from a fire box. Streaming is generally fine once it is working, but, man, can it be slooooooooooow to load the home screen, respond to a button press, etc. Also, it sometimes randomly fails and provides zero feedback. For example, I recently adjusted my wifi access point to use a DFS frequency. The fire stick stopped connected to the wifi with ""unexpected error"". I tried a variety of things including ""forgetting"" the network, rebooting the stick, etc. Never did I get a useful error message. This thing is supposed to support a/n/ac, but it can't deal with a DFS frequency. No other device in my household had this problem. We've had other random issues here and there.<br /><br />Fwiw, I do provide the usb connection for power, but it complains about not having usb power. I don't get it.

Thought I would try this unit when the price was dropped to replace a 2nd generation dot that was playing thru Bose Series 3 speakers.  So I simply removed the Dot and installed the input.

So I went back  to using the tried and true dot that has given no problems for many months.  I cannot recommend the input, even at the low price.

B07BHF993Q,3,3.6666666666666665,1,2,"Pros:<br />Great sound, bass is good and clean.<br />Wook well with Alexa.<br />Bluetooth connectivity is excellent. Woks well with iPhone7.<br />Voice microphone is almost more clear than my phone.<br /><br />Cons<br />Fitting took some time to get use to. More bulky than wired buds but that's understandable, due to battery.<br /><br />Over all a great set of ear buds I would easily recommend. Ok after using this pair for over a year now, I can write a proper review for it. First few months worked great, no issue. After about a year, I got 3 highlighted problems that keep happening. 1/ the system/bluetooth connection started to fail, it won’t connect to my phone, or is able to connect but has really loud random static. 2/ Random loud static, freaked me out many times. 3/ Won’t charge when i put them back in the pod, the pod is full of battery, but the pair just won’t take power from it. Today i was using the headphone while doin yard work, worked for 15 mins then they has decided to stop working completely, the app won’t recognize them, they don't take power from a fully charged pod. I’m done with these. Their sound worked great, i don’t have a problem with sound quality, it seems like its the connection system fails, between phone and headphones and pod… Spent $200 on these originally, i’ll probably buy a different brand because I want them to last at least 3 years. I freakin'  love these earbuds. They are incredibly comfortable and won't budge during my workouts or runs. These buds tuck nicely into its oval shaped charging case, which stores the pods in between my workouts and keeps them from getting lost. I find that the charging pod case is extremely hard to open. Actually, you have to squeeze and open the case at the same time to lift the lid to get it open. Love the google assistant feature as well. These buds can last 5 hours on their own and then an additional 10 hours if they are charged up in between workouts. ( Much longer than my Apple earpods. )<br /><br />You can find other less expensive wireless bluetooth earphones, but the alternatives either aren't sweat resistant for workouts, or don't fit as well. So overall, they are a very good set to own.",0.3333333333333333,3
B07BW245J3,4,4.5,0,4,"The audio is OK, not high end. The mic is low end and to far to the back of the headset. But for $10 its good for cheap or retro fun.<br />The old style head band is nice,it has a low hair pulling effect and also very low profile. So it fits under a Bicycle helmet easy and doesn't give you the giant round hoodie head when put on your favorite sweat top hoodie.<br />Came with a micro usb charge cord. And your choice of blue or orange ear pads.<br />(Also I comes in a classic Retro package, the is extremely hard to open without cutting it open. Just so someone can enjoy being to frustrated to cut open the package, and just enjoy tearing it to shreads like everyone did back then.) I have small ears, so earbuds simply do not stay in.  Even the ones with the ear loops fall out.  So I've always used over-the-ear headphones.  The big ones are too clunky.  These are just right!  The head band can be bent so as to achieve the right pressure, and the bluetooth aspect makes it so easy to wear when I am out and about and not having to worry about a cord getting in my way.  Others have mentioned that finding and using the charging port is a bit wonky, and it's true.  Sound quality is not concert-hall, by any means, but respectable enough.  I actually like that it's not noise-canceling, as I walk in the city and like to know what's coming up on me.  I do wish there was a volume control on the headphones, instead of having to control it on my device, but it's a small bother.  I would absolutely buy again if these ever die on me. I love these! I wanted something that wasn’t bulky and had no wires. I also did NOT want noise cancellation because I use it for walks around town and want to hear if there’s something approaching, a car horn, etc. And unlike earbuds, they don’t fall out and get lost. For the price these are great! I listen to podcasts, so I can’t speak to the music fidelity. I needed a headset that I could plug into my phone, my kindle, and my computer. These were sort of cute, so I figured what the hey? I'll give them a try.<br /><br />They fit good, and while listening to audio books, as long as I keep the volume in the mid range (and who wants books screamed at them?), it does great. I wish they'd made the volume control a little bit more intuitive. Instead of dealing with the headset, I used the volume control on whatever I had plugged them into.  Be advised, and I would hope this is only mine but don't know, if you turn up the volume too high, there is a lot of distortion and some noise that comes through the headset. The distortion was the most irritating to me, thus why I adjust the volume on the device, and make sure it doesn't go over mid range.<br /><br />For the money, these are functioning, cute headsets",0.0,3

Most pricey headphones have a jack to allow you to use it on a plane, and in most cases, you don’t need an intermediary.  Sorry that I got this. If you travel a lot you know airplanes and rental cars are like a box of chocolates......you never know what you’re going to get. Even if you reserve something specific there are no guarantees. But with this little gadget, as long as you have a headphone or aux jack somewhere you should be good to go. Read the instructions....it’s not quite plug and play, but not rocket science either.

B07D7X145N,3,3.6666666666666665,1,2,"I can get it to come on and the light comes on. It looks great. I cannot get it to connect to my phone to use it as a speaker.  I tried different ways. I will try my husband's phone soon and see if it works with the iphone. I cannot get it to work with my android, which is very unusual. Okay, yeah, it's got a 128 LED lights and that's more and better than the ones that have only 60. . . or 96 lights. I already had one nearly, no exactly identical light/speaker to this with 96 lights. Now maybe there's a visible difference between 128 LEDs and 60, there pretty much has to be. But I have my 96 light speaker in the same shower nook as the new, 128 light speaker and Other than the large 1 I wrote on the bottom of the original speaker (96 lights) I can't tell them apart. That being long windedly said they're beautiful however many lights they have. As mentioned I have them both in the same wall nook in my shower and when I take a shower at night I use only the simulated fire from the two lights and it is awesome. The two speakers will sync into a stereo configuration very easily. Just sync once each and then turn them on. The speakers have decent sound as long as you remember they're small drivers running 5 watts each. More than enough for a shower, bedroom or out on a deck or patio for a small party.<br />About the only thing I don't like about these units are the white rim ring light and button lights for vilume, power, changing songs stay on the whole time and they're quite bright. I understand that you'll need to find the control buttons but the bright white lights detract slightly from the fire effect. They should either be orange/red to to match the fire effect LEDs or turn off after a short period of time. Besides that I really enjoy having these around. They hold a charge for weeks. Granted I only use them a few times a week for showers but I've never run them out of charge I end up thinking I should charge them because it's been a month or more since the last time they were charged.<br />Fun, entertaining light with a decent speaker, can be paired into stereo configuration.

Awesome sounds! It's been over a year since we bought these. We loved the lights and the speakers worked well. But about a month ago, the speakers would have a weird white noise. It doesn't matter if the computer is muted because it's been getting louder and persistent. It sounds a bad connection. I've tried using different connectors and nothing. The noise is so loud and obnoxious now. We don't even use the speakers. Good for a year. Broken now.

B07DW4NWQB,3,5.0,0,3,"Well.. I needed to find a headset that could perform double duty. Not ever purchasing a Bluetooth/noise canceling headset before I wasn’t sure what to expect! To say the least.. I had to rely on reviews and what I found sounded promising!<br /><br />The sound is better than expected. Being one<br />who was born in the 70’s.. I actually was around when this style of headset made its rocking debut for the first time- Let’s just say.. the sound/fit and quality have reached new heights!! DON’T anyone be fooled by the retro throwback style.. this is a fit that is actually comfortable now and not, head throbbing tight on the temples- or, tweaking ones<br />ear due to the cup made to fit.. Um?! Oh yeah, made to fit no one.. !! Instead these have enough stretch to make it feel nice and adjust in height/angle. I will say- there’s a wee bit of ear sweat bc, the material used doesn’t breathe 100%.. Yet, I'm sure it must be necessary to create a better sound quality!<br /><br />I won’t lie...These aren’t featherweight as if, you could just forget you have them on- but, You can definitely notice the attention to detail that went into making these ergonomically shaped and the care in using light weight material. Where I noticed the weight of the headset most, is when I’d lean my head forward to look at my phone (interesting- we all look down to use our phone- we don’t ever bring our phone up?!) But, doing this I could feel the weight in back of my neck.. Now, I’m sure after using these a few times, you would build up those muscles pretty quick! But, just Something to keep in mind-<br />First need was to take on road trip so, I could hear music I liked. Sound itself was not like anything I’d ever heard and I know, it sounds ignorant but- if this isn’t your thing.. how Would you know what to expect?!! Yesss!!! I have used earphones before..<br />ie. On a plane or, book on tape at the pool, etc.. Style used is the type that slips into the ear and plugs into a device. I’ve also used AirPod before as well.. But, with this Srhythm or, as I like to call it- “retro” headset.. Best way to describe differences to a lament like myself: Imagine watching a movie at home on a regular TV vs. watching the same movie in a kick-butt dolby theater with surround, upgrades, whistles and bells! Either will suffice. But, knowing the difference- Why would you ever want anything less.. HeLLo!!!<br />The Noise canceling option is just a flip of a button and I’m wondering why these aren’t a mandatory gift for parents bringing newborns home from the hospital! They don’t make every sound disappear, rather.. they deafen the noise to let you think and concentrate- this was my other need in getting this headset. I have the hardest time typing emails and papers with verbal conversation happening around me… Knowing this is a weakness, I wanted to try this novel concept- and Wow! it’s perfect for what I need- I’m sold and a total fan!!! It takes out all the noise clutter yet, let’s you hear needed sounds if necessary. If you have this issue- try this, you won’t be disappointed.<br />I’ll admit hooking into Bluetooth was intimidating so, my kiddos did it for me in about 2 seconds. (I don’t care enough about certain things to learn it myself…) The ability to use all options this offers will prob. be too much and not fall in my wheel house- but, for those who want extras.. these have them! Or, you can choose to use in simplest form and be happy with your purchase. After pricing against others brands of the same quality.. these are hands down the best deal.. if you buy, Im sure these won’t disappoint!! This one is my favorite headset, and I own I think 5 different noise cancelling headsets at this point. I actually also own the little baby brother the NC25 of this one which I also love. They are really close but this one I think wins because of the battery life but the other one folds up to a closer headset so for traveling it would win. A batter of 40+ hours of playtime is incredible, you just can't beat that since you don't have to charge it every day like you would have to with the other one.<br /><br />This headset has other amazing features as well. It paired pretty much instantly without any issues. The volume can go up very high if you really want to destroy your hearing but it allows you really to listen to your music quietly with very good sound quality. The noise cancelling feature works very well and allows you to block out noise you don't want to hear like coworkers or noise on the air plane so you can actually hear the movie you want to watch<br /><br />Not only does the battery last 40+ hours of play back, but also is the battery a fast charge, so it will charge fully in 1-2 towers. In 5 minutes you can get 2+ hours of battery life back into your headset! This is absolutely amazing. This headset will replace the one I have at work right now and will be my go to one for everything.<br /><br />These headsets are super comfortable and lightweight so you barely feel they are there, just like their little baby brother. I can't say enough good things about these and can only recommend them. At $70 plus currently they have a discount of $15.<br /><br />They come with a nice little carrying case, plus a charging cable, an audio cable and an airplane adapter. Just absolutely perfect!<br /><br />So the NC75 pro and NC25 are very comparable. The quality in both is fantastic. The NC25 is smaller but the NC75Pro has a better battery life and is slightly more expensive, so really up to you but you can't go wrong with either really in my eyes. These headphones are easy to operate, do a good job cancelling noise in the room from televisions, kids, dogs and husbands. They are also comfortable. They were so simple to set up. I set them up on my laptop. I held in the square  button until  I heard that the speakers were on. Then I checked my laptop system information and ran the Bluetooth device and there they were. Put on one of my songs and I had to turn the volume  down quite a bit. They get plenty loud. I am very impressed with these headphones. I may be swapping out the ones I use nightly for these.",0.0,3
B07FZ8S74R,10,4.4,1,9,"I like the size of it, makes it so you don't have to make the Alexa your main personality of a room. However, it's not very good at picking up commands from a distance, and though it has gotten better via software updates, it still doesn't always get the command right. I think the worst part though, is the sound quality. If you have an Alexa you better plan to get some sort of external speaker, because the Alexa's speaker is not great. I love my Echo Dot. It is quick to respond and sounds great. BUT there is one MAJOR drawback...it must be plugged in<br />, there is NO battery backup! So if you use Echo Dot as your alarm clock (for example) and the power goes out,  be prepared to be late for work.  Also, there is nothing on it to indicate that the power is out so you won't find out until you go to use it. The sound quality is great and it's extremely useful when plugged in but it's not as portable or reliable as it obviously could be. Perfect addition to our home. Connects easily to bluetooth speakers and all other smart devices in the home. I like Alexa, her voice is crystal clear and the music sounds as if it's come from an expensive speaker!!!<br />I chose the Alexa Echo due to its small size!! I also chose the darker color so that my Grandchildren would not notice it!  This way I don't have to worry about them touching it!! Fast shipping, great little speaker. Great little speaker. Alexa is helpful with handsfree. I use it currently in our daughters nursery for night time music. The wifi could be better, the device has froze up a couple of times where I had to restart it. Once when I playing my  music on it. I got this little device for Mother’s Day, and I’m completely underwhelmed by what little it will do. The biggest issue is the fact that there’s no rechargeable battery and you’re tethered to a wall with an outlet for the short Echo cord whenever you want to use it. It’s easier to pick up my wireless Bose Blu-Tooth speaker and connect it to my phone so I can move from room to room to outside. And I find I almost always have to repeat my commands at least twice to get Echo to respond. We’re empty-nesters, (I’m a retired teacher), and I don’t feel like communicating with teenagers on a daily basis anymore Great smart speaker [[VIDEOID:855c8712023b62c9e7cf3ecaecc9639f]] I absolutely love dealing with Alexa I cannot have questions and she answers them for me I want to listen to music to play it's what I like I want to hear my audio books and she reads them back perfectly. I have questions about anything and she seems to be able to answer that she recognizes my voice from another room she can hear it over the television. I love when I leave my home I can ask her to guard the house and she listens out for the smoke detector as well as for the sound of breaking glass which means I am more comfortable knowing that my dog being at home by himself  we'll be okay because she will alert me if something's wrong and there's better chance of him being saved if there's a fire or break in .  There are so many features that I haven't even experienced yet and I'm looking forward to finding out about  with Alexa Echo Dot . Definitely an asset in my home.. When we remodeled our Kitchen, I installed a compact stereo system for my wife inside one of her many cabinets with speakers installed in the ceiling.  I attached the Dot to the stereo, closed the cabinet doors and when we want to change what it is playing on the stereo, I speak as if it was in front of  me and  it immediately responds.

Err I knew right away that these would be my office headphones. I have a mechanical keyboard that I use at work, and the office I work in is semi-open. There's a *lot* of noise coming every-which-way. These are a much-needed accessory to my work productivity, as I'm easily distracted by things in my periphery, whether visually or auditory.<br /><br />The presentation is great. The box is very high quality, reminiscent of the recent Samsung Galaxy device boxes. A smooth matte feel with gloss--weirdly pristine. The box slides out of the slipcover and you get the headphones already in the case. What I like is that they're folded, and there's even a little sheet underneath the phones that always reminds you how to put them back in. Also included is a 3.5mm cable in case you don't want to use Bluetooth, a charging cable, and an adapter. The case is nice, but as I keep mine at work I can't testify to its durability. There's a thin mesh net on the backside in case anyone needs to store one or two thin headphone accessory/-ies along. The accent colors are a nice light copper/rose gold color. I love that color; I'm glad it's getting more attention in recent years.<br /><br />It didn't take long to charge the headphones, so they come with a little bit of juice. As soon as you turn them on, you get a soft beep along with a voice indicating they're turned on. Nice responsive feedback. Once I put them on I could hear the headphones working to drown out the sound; there was a thick veil of soundproofing that was draped over my ears as soon as the earpads touched them.<br /><br />The first thing I did was listen to podcasts through the Pocket Casts app and .flac music through Poweramp v3. With podcasts, the difference was phenomenal. Listening to ""Wait, wait... Don't tell me!"" made me feel as though I were in the audience. The music was fantastic...until I tried on my other headphones which I use for music only.<br />I thought the bass might've been too strong with the Sony headphones, and I was right. After using even ""cheaper"" headphones like the Audio-Technica M50x, I could tell the Sony had too much bass. I'm not sure if that's partly because of the noise-canceling technology or what, but the bass can be toned down a bit, methinks.<br /><br />I then proceeded to download the supplementary app to get the fullest suite of attributes the headphones can get. The app works well, and I didn't experience any hiccups while actually using the app. The only hiccup was when I was trying to download the update. It took *forever*. Almost an hour and it was just halfway through. I decided to bring them to work the next day and let the app sit there while updating. Thankfully, it remembers the progress, even though the app kept crashing during the update process.<br /><br />There are some optimization tweaks in the app, some sound profiles to let you configure the noise cancelation level (yes, level; the noise cancelation is pure software; you can set it to drown out the most noise as possible or have no noise cancellation at all), and even a little snippet of what is currently playing through the headphones. A simple UI with all the features you need.<br /><br />The first few days I used it I was active, and I kept noticing that my ears sometimes would pop depending on whether I sat down or arose quickly. Another weird thing is that when I take the headphones off, my ears sometimes need a minute or two to adjust. There's so much noise in the world! After taking the headphones off I can hear HVAC activity and my loud work neighbor who's otherwise not that loud.<br /><br />I had some headphones with some touch controls before and always found them tacky. I used them once when I first got them and never again. But with these headphones, I'm always using the tap gesture to play/pause and the swipe gesture to raise or lower the volume. There are also swipe gestures to skip or go back a track, but since I never do that anyway I never use those gestures. You have to be careful with the tap; when it works, it works. But the whole surface isn't the active portion and you have to hit it right in the center. Sometimes I'm hitting my finger against my ears trying to find the spot and hurting myself in the process. I tested the gesture where you put your entire palm on the cup to turn off the noise canceling feature and let the mic allow incoming conversation, but not after the third try. I could hear the other people just fine, but I found the right hand over my ear felt awkward, and one person didn't realize I could even hear them. Putting your hand over your headphones isn't a gesture people immediately see as you paying attention to them.<br /><br />The headphones are extremely lightweight and comfortable to use; I left them on for about two hours once before having to take them off. I actually was surprised with how light they were; when I got the Amazon box I didn't believe it was my headphones. It was much lighter than expected.<br /><br />For my first noise-canceling headphones I'm pleased. The sound balance can be better (less bass), but they make for fantastic headphones to use at work. I wasn't sure what I was expecting with noise-canceling technology. I thought it would drown out all noises, but you still can hear the occasional mutter; it just won't be distinct.<br /><br />Oh, forgot to mention the battery life. I charged it only once and have been using it for a week, at about an hour or two each day. Still going well. If you press the power button once it will tell you the battery level. AFter the initial update the voice indicator might give the wrong battery level (it did for me), but give it about ten or fifteen minutes to adjust and it will go back to normal. For the price, I'd expect a little bit of magic... They're great headphones, comfortable on the head, and the noise cancelling is great, but having to hold the power button for 3 seconds to turn on doesn't feel like a $300 pair of headphones from 2019. I wish they 1. Turned on automatically when you put them on, and 2. turned off or paused automatically when you take them off.<br /><br />The volume control/touch control isn't intuitive at all, either. I like to think I'm a pretty smart guy, and I couldnt figure it out without reading the instructions. A product that requires reading the manual for full operation is a badly designed product. Just look at apple. They don't make a product that a 5 year old couldn't pick up and use. As much as I disagree with them as a company, they've set the bar for product usability, and at this price point I expect nothing less.<br /><br />A $350 pair of headphones in 2019 that has little more in the way of user comforts than a $50 pair is kind of sad. I have had these for a day. They are absolutely amazing.  Life changing, worth every penny. I have seen a lot of reviews where they were compared to AirPods Pros, but there is no comparison.<br /><br />I bought them because I have a noisy (but lovable) neighbor. The noise cancellation on these is superior, but not for low, bassy, external sounds, but rather sounds in the higher range.<br /><br />My advise, and to save you some time: Do not get the app. It is so invasive of your information, and I know all apps are, but this one is probably the worst. You can set up bluetooth with all your devices without the app, and use all the features, no problem.<br /><br />It also has Alexa built in, which is insane, I have yet to pull the trigger on giving Alexa permission, but I think I will; there is an Alexa button, I THINK that's the only time it's listening. If you're like me, and you have Amazon Prime Music the combo is insane.<br /><br />A few cons: the Noise Cancellation will pound your ears if you’re not listening to content. I didn’t know it could do this, but I can see why people say they can only wear them for so long.<br /><br />Do not under any circumstance get the app. It’s much more invasive than any app I’ve seen (of tkunborher to read the privacy (publicity) statement. Your earphones can operate fine without the app.",0.0,3
B07G9Y3ZMC,5,4.2,1,4,"Strong audio  quality I am very happy with this product and have been listening to music a lot more because of it.  The device detects the room and adjusts, so that it is totally tailored to your environment.  I notice that  it doesn't bother anyone in the next room in my house, but it still delivers rich sound with details I just don't get from my smaller Echo units.  I would love to have this speaker in a bar format for my TV with a cable, not bluetooth...but I'm sure that will be on the horizon. Could not get this to work with my other speakers in the house and you know who I can’t say now because she’ll be yelling. Yes can I help you? But you have to buy two of these to get stereo out of instead of using your existing, which is quite odd and I’m not spending $400 for speakers so in my opinion unless you’re rich and can afford two of these don’t buy them. This is a great speaker.  We placed it in our kitchen to replace the original Echo Plus we had there since we listen to a lot of music while cooking and/or doing things in the vicinity.  The only downside is that for some reason this Echo now responds when we're in our bedroom (where we have an Echo Dot with Clock) rather than the Echo in our bedroom.  I'm guessing the microphone on this device is just better/more sensitive. Great clear sound. The stand alone subwoofer had more bass than this tho.",0.2,0

You'll even get a man's voice when you turn your car on telling you ""waiting for connection,"" and then ""successfully paired"" once it syncs up, which doesn't take long at all.<br /><br />CONS:<br />You have to leave the car on that radio station all the time for the Bluetooth to work, so this is better if you don't rely on scanning the radio much for car entertainment and use your phone for music more often. You also have to search for a phone number on your phone itself, so it's not ideal for calling people while driving unless you make the phone call first.<br /><br />PROS:<br />There are two USB charger ports, so you can charge two phones at the same time (or two devices that use USBs). And here's an added bonus - the charger is turbocharged! I charged my phone from 14% to 65% in a 20-minute trip - excellent! Also, I was listening to an audio book on and off, and every time I turned the car on, the volume remained the same for the audio book - I didn't have to fiddle with it at all.<br /><br />I didn't even know adding Bluetooth to your car was this easy. I thought I'd have to pay $300 for a mechanic to install it, so I put it off as something I just can't have in my husband's car. But this device makes it an almost seamless experience. The only true caveat I have with it is that I have to load up a phone number to call before I drive, but other than that, you just can't beat this little device for such a low price!",0.0,1
B07GZNK328,3,3.6666666666666665,0,3,"These wireless headphones were easy to set up with my iPhone. I usually use them while using the elliptical at the gym. The earbuds stay in my ear. One drawback is that they are not especially comfortable - the earbuds aren’t soft. I’m usually only using them for about 30 minutes at a time but I could see them becoming extremely uncomfortable with prolonged use - so I decreased my review by one star.<br />The color of the earbuds is nice and the sound is clear. The batteries last a decent amount of time. I usually charge them prior to each time I use them though. One more thing to stop all conversation!  Our granddaughter loves these - first of all, the color - and then the sound quality.  It was difficult to separate her from them when it was study time, but the good thing is that she likes them enough to take care of them.  We’ve bought so many earbuds - it looks like this set may actually be around for a while.  The sound quality is excellent - we had to give them a try! I am not a fan of these earbuds - which is no surprise since I was not a fan of iPhone earbuds. I just can't get these situated in my ears properly without hurting. I just have an issue with quite a few earbuds and end up using earphones instead, which is not easy if you are trying to sleep. The sound is okay and my granddaughter will most likely love these - they will match her mouse.",0.0,3
B07HT12PD5,3,4.333333333333333,0,3,"Water proof and the powerful sound is terrific;  just what I need for a speaker at a small home. This is substantial equipment, I just weighed it on my kitchen scale and it is 2 pounds ie 32 ounces. Note: CHARGING CORD IS NOT INCLUDED, so if you are buying as a gift make sure you include a charging cord (what you use for your cell phone is the type you need). ALSO, it is not ready to use out of the box so you might want to charge it before gifting it.  FYI - the speaker can be used while it’s charging - 3 hour charge time from empty to full, it's also best to charge from an outlet rather than your computer.  Lastly, the powerful Voice prompts volume cannot be adjusted.<br /><br />FYI, it does NOT support flash memory, it does have a USB port but it is only for using the battery to charge another device like a phone and not for playing music (which would have been great).  It comes with an AUX port so I will be using it with my iPod in addition to wirelessly (100 ft Range) with my phone or tablet.  I haven't tried it but it says the speaker can be paired with another Boost speaker for stereo sound. I camp, I hike, I play outdoors, and I have 5 kids...  So you know that I need waterproof electronics!!!  This fits the bill, I've spilled some water on it just to prove that it works (didn't submerge it yet) and it kept on playing...  I might even consider this for the shower in the future. Having outdoor safe speakers is essential for my household.  Not only do I have audiophiles who are addicted to headphones and speakers, I have a husband who insists on taking his speakers to outdoor jobs.  that is fine except when the job turns out to have a sudden rainstorm or high dust going on.  Before giving it to him, I had our daughter put it through the grind at work (food prep) and in town events.  Let's see how this speaker performs..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS SPEAKER LIKE?<br />This speaker is gray in color.  The housing is very rubbery in consistency.  The right side of the speaker has sealed controls under a rubberized pad over top of the buttons.  The speaker stays put and is heavier than expected.<br /><br />ON/OFF BUTTON/PAIRING<br />Holding down for over a second powers up the speaker.  Next to the power button is the PAIRING button.  This is not for pairing the speaker to a device but it is for pairing with another speaker just like it.  A coworker with my daughter has this speaker and they tested it out- works GREAT so you now get two synced speakers.<br /><br />CALLS BUTTON<br />You can send and receive calls with this button. You can also access your voice commands on your phone with this button.<br /><br />VOLUME BUTTON<br />This is plus or minus sound controls.  You can also skip by holding down- + is forward, - is backward.<br /><br />PAUSE/PLAY<br />You can control pausing and playing with this button.<br /><br />DOCKING<br />USB for charging, mini USB port (to use to charge a device if need be), and auxiliary outlet for like an old MP3 player or other device that does not have Bluetooth capability.<br /><br />CHARGING INDICATOR LIGHT<br />Red when charging and turns white when fully charged.  Will indicate when the power is running low so you will know.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY<br />Sound quality with this is very good.  My daughter has a coworker with the same speaker so they both have had a chance to experiment with their speakers.  So far it has been a great speaker.  The balance of the recording of course affects the speaker, but so far it has not been overly muffled, out of balance, etc.  Where you put the speaker affects how it sounds too.<br /><br />When put on the floor, it really does sound better than on, say top of a box, or couch, etc.  A very hard surface seems to really make it sound best.<br /><br />VOLUME<br />When using the volume controls on the speaker, the sound is better than when you use the volume controls on the device (tablet, phone, etc).<br /><br />DURABILITY<br />This speaker was taken to a huge town chicken and biscuit dinner and was dropped and still is working perfectly.<br /><br />BATTERY<br />Two 10 hour shifts at full volume, and this speaker kicked through it all before needing to be recharged.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a really nice durable speaker that is dustproof, shock proof, and supposedly water proof, this is a good choice.  It is solid, has decent sound , and even can be synced with another speaker if you get two of these for coverage around a room.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. This is a decent speaker, and I feel more comfortable having my husband use this on his jobs than the other really nice speaker he was beating up.",0.0,0
B07HZLHPKP,6,3.8333333333333335,0,6,"I love my Echo Dot 'Alexa'. She turns on and off my lights, reminds me to take my meds, and plays any song I request on my Prime music list. That said... When my daughter moved to Fl. and video chatting was all we have, I decided to get the Echo Show 5.  The sound of the Echo Show is far richer than the Dot. At first, I did not like the fact that Alexa's voice was now muted by bass. I solved the problem with the Amazon Alexa app, where I was able to go to audio settings and adjust the bass and treble.<br />Any music played on the Echo Show is far superior to that of the Dot (no offense to my Echo Dot, I still love it).<br />REVISION: I'm 'old school' and believe in 'manuals, paper manuals' for guided instructions. I had to 'Google' how to change the settings on the Echo Show so I could access options on what would be appearing on the screen. This was after I complained to Amazon and they said they would forward my complaint about too many ads appearing. They never told me to check my settings and I had no manual to guide me. So I think I have now gotten rid of 'cooking recipes' and movie suggestions for little children. I LOVE TECHNOLOGY, but please, give accompanying manuals. I am amazed at how good this is. I use it mostly for music and now I get the beautiful sound ""everywhere"" when paired with Alexa Echo bluetooth. The surround sound is exquisite .  This is the best gift to myself ever. I have every Alexa device possible—- this one does not “hear” well. I even propped the speaker and mic up in case the design blocked it. Nothing. Not as good as the other devices... in fact, the other devices hear my commands from the other room<br />bEFORE this one. I only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't connect with my TV like it claims it should. I thought it would turn on and off my TV with the voice. My remote to my TV has a voice button.<br />I do like using it as an alarm clock though. Auto dims and is a photo slide show, it sounds decent also, but I have better Bluetooth speakers. My kids like asking it to play a certain songs and ask it to tell them a joke. I love my echo dot, but this is my new favorite.  In addition to everything that the dot does, this has some really cool special features.  The screen cycles through my favorite pictures when I'm not using it.  I can check on my blink cameras.  I can even watch prime video or YouTube on it.  It's definitely worth the extra money.  My only complaint is that the sound quality isn't as good, but I plan to connect it to a better speaker. It’s small I like my 8 inch so much better the speaker so much louder on my 8 compared to this one.",0.0,4
B07J2Z5DBM,15,4.333333333333333,2,13,"So much better than the Apple headphones and I was pleasantly surprised. Great value for the money and the charge lasts a long time! *Update* after trying to use these for a few days, I'm disappointed.  They are great except that they won't stay in my ears.  There's nothing to hold them in place. They are okay for emergency use, but only if I'm using just the right one and I'm laying on my left side so it stays in.<br /><br />I've got several versions of Samsung wireless earbuds. I get a new set about every other year.  The case on these is about the size of two samsung charging cases put together. It's just massive. But it charged quickly and the wireless charging works just fine.  I called my mother to test the call quality since she is the most discerning about my earbud call quality and she was impressed at the quality for the cost. My galaxy buds were a refurbished buy from Best Buy and she could never understand me when I used them (no one else really had a problem hearing me with them). The galaxy buds live has good sound and call quality, but very poor battery life and comfort in use.  They always popped out of my ears if I smiled or laughed and they pushed against that little flap and caused pain.<br />So far, these little things are doing pretty good.  I have weird shaped ear canals so the left one didn't hold in very well (but it almost never does with any of these) but, the right one is holding in good.  I'm not thrilled with the shape because it's hard to know where to line it up,  but for the money,  I'm sold. Great sound quality. They fit perfectly and are very comfortable. It includes four different sizes of ear caps. It’s so nice to be able to wear earbuds that don’t hurt my ears while keep other voices or noises out. The price is great for such amazing quality. Wow sounds great and bass is heavy, midrange and treble is present and does not drown out at high volumes. Wireless charging works flawlessly. Use these at the gym and when doing lawn work. Love these headphones These headphones are pretty great for the price. The sound quality is great, and the pickup range is good too. They aren't super noise cancelling, but do well enough that other noises aren't distracting. I love that they come with 4 sizes of buds because I have very small ears, and a lot of headphones are too large to fit. These are comfortable and stay in, although I haven't tried them at the gym yet. Call audio is also very clear. The earbuds are very comfortable and the instructions were clear.  The black case is sturdy and the battery life is amazing!  The quality is better than average -- I've bought other Bluetooth wireless earbuds and these are the best quality and well worth the price! When I tried these on I was pleasantly surprised by the noise cancellation and sound quality of the earbuds. They sound much better than others. The charge and pair easily, and are comfortable to wear. I like the sound quality the battery life is not good and the earbuds keep falling out of my ears. I did put the small earpiece on the earbuds but even with that and not moving they fall out. These headphones are very good and well priced. I wear mine to the gym and I have no issues with cords anymore and it’s amazing. Sound isn’t bad, and they are sleek. Solid wireless headphones with amazing sound quality. These earbuds were well made.  The sound was clear and of good quality.  They had a nice magnetic charging case and charged well.  I would like a volume control on the ear piece, but they were worth the money. Great headphones! They sounds good and fit well. These are best ear buds I've purchased. They came on time and came fully charged. These T100 are simple to use and ready to go right out of the box. Pull both out together wait 10 secs to pair then simply connect to bluetooth. They actually have pretty going noise cancelling properties! It's cool they can be wirelessly charged in the car! Good sound and very light weight! I can only write a review on half the product. Only half of it works. one earbud works, the other constantly connects and disconnects. Very disappointed as it was a Christmas present and they are less than three weeks old. I would recommend you spend the extra money and get a decent pair. Decent audio but not great for critical listening. They aren't noise canceling and they don't isolate much better than any rubber buds. I enjoy the battery life and case with extra battery. Also the wireless charging.",0.13333333333333333,3
B07JL2NDSQ,3,4.666666666666667,0,3,"My daughter has been wanting her own record player. She has a few albums of her own, but wanted to be able to listen to them in her bedroom, not the living room. It's really cute and the color is perfect in her room. She loves the retro feel that it has. It doesn't take up a lot of room and sits nicely on a small little table. The sound quality is okay, and adequate for her. It's not going to satisfy the audiophiles, but honestly, at the price it's listed at, I wouldn't expect it to be a high end machine. Great little mobile record player. Easy to use and the sound is actually pretty good. You can also hook up to any RCA input jack speaker system. I think the on board speakers a actually good enough for the experience. My only gripe is the power cord doesn't pack into the suitcase, making you have to carry it separately. Other than that it's a great product that works with the hundreds of old records we have. my 22 year old son LOVES this record player.  I thought he'd just try it once or twice and be done with it but nope, he LOVES it... listens to some of my old records, a couple he found at Goodwill and I've even  ordered him some online that aren't here yet, but he's really looking forward to it.  I'm not sure what it is about this 'retro' technology that enchants him but I'm thrilled to see him enjoying music I grew up on and not viewing my love of records as 'hokey'.  The record player itself is really nice, comes with a cord so you can hook up speakers to it if you want (it would have been nice if the record player had a compartment to store the cord in so we don't lose it.) but otherwise it's a huge hit... oh and it does have a companion record storage case you can purchase as well... we haven't yet but probably will need to in the very near future.",0.0,0
B07JZSXYHB,3,4.333333333333333,0,3,"This is a lightweight set,  and they are about as good for their price.  There is a slight tintiness when using them, but for a quick earbud in my laptop or Kindle Fire,  it serves the purpose.  I like the sound for my Youtube music or IPOD.  However,  the lengthy wire will get tangled if not careful.  Nice packaging. The idea behind these earbuds are great! To use a metal casing around the wires. It keeps them from getting tangles and protects the internal wires from just breaking - which has happened to every pair of earbuds I own. I would love to get the pair that has the capability to make calls with. A great value and the sound quality is really good. Warning: be careful on rugs during the winter! Causes electric shocks and it does shock your ears! When I go on vacation, I want to take earbuds like these, because they sound good and they take up less room. The wires on buds is usually what ends up going south. These wires seem to be stronger and I like that they don't tangle. I like how I can customize the sound with these too.

B07MLY3JKV,9,4.222222222222222,2,7,"The ECHO FLEX is perfect for my powder room.  It plugs directly into an electrical outlet above the vanity sink, and it doesn’t require either (1) a cord, or (2) an accessory shelf to hold it out of the way (above the vanity countertop).  Thus it reduces clutter around the sink; and it is safer than a regular Echo or Echo Dot in this location.  (You can’t accidentally knock it into a sinkful of water.)<br /><br />The Echo Flex connects through the Alexa app, and does everything that the other Echo devices do.  For my household, this means turning lights or tv on and off; setting timers and reminders; asking for local weather or traffic information; checking the time; asking general knowledge questions; doing math and recipe calculations; playing music; and “dropping in” on Echo devices in other rooms (using the Echos as an intercom).  The speaker isn't up to audiophile standards for playing music, but it's fine for playing casual background music and for hearing the spoken word.<br /><br />The Echo Flex is especially great for my husband, who is hard of hearing.  When he’s in the powder room now, he can hear me when I “drop in” even if the water is running.  The Echo Flex is located only about a yard away.  (He can’t hear me when I “drop in” to a bedroom device that is located about 15 feet away.)<br /><br />Setup takes about 5 minutes if you have already downloaded the Alexa app.  After you plug the Echo Flex in, it advises you to open the Alexa app to complete the setup.  The app takes you the rest of the way through setup. Sound is tinny you could add a external speaker for better sound. Plug right in outlet no cord in the way. The only slightly negative comment is that the audio is a little tinny and not very loud. Alexa is much louder and have a wider range. Not intended for music, but functions nicely when paired with an external speaker It works great and small enough to take to different rooms. Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa. OZ Our laundry room is downstairs and often I cannot hear the bell go off when the washer or the dryer is finished. We had a cheap baby monitor in the laundry room and the receiver in the living room and monitored the laundry that way, but it was fifteen years old and static-y. Audio-only baby monitors in stores had terrible ratings and were about 30 dollars. For reasons too long to enumerate, we bought an Echo Show 5, so we moved the previously-used Echo Dot in the laundry room and used it for drop-ins; the sound was so much better. But I wanted the Dot for use in another room and using it just as a ""baby monitor"" seemed silly. Then I saw this little Flex on sale! Since I won't be playing music on it, there's no need for optimum sound out of the tiny speakers, and it's still useful for dropping in, asking the time or the temperature, etc. This is a great alternative to the Dot if you're not concerned with sound fidelity; talked to my husband on it via drop in and he says the sound coming via the Flex is pretty good! Why are they not available now? It’s a great device!!! I’m not a ‘tech’ person at all! I’m a single female that’s 65 years old and have problems with almost all of these things EXCEPT for this one! This is a small, handy ‘plug’ with a mini speaker - great for a relatively unused room. I have mine in my 3rd spare bedroom that I use for my ironing board, drying rack, etc. I’m home alone just about every day and I have music playing from the time I get up in the morning till I fall asleep at night and with this I can now hear it while I’m doing my laundry chores. The sound quality isn’t great but acceptable for its purpose and Alexa responds quickly and very well with my voice commands, whether it’s music related or something else! I like that it’s both a small plug and has some of the capabilities of an Echo Dot, Show, and the other larger Smart devices. I can also use the USB port and normal, non ‘smart’ outlet. The cost was minimal and I’m really bummed that I can’t buy this anymore! I only started using ‘smart’ things several months ago and now I’m slowly adding more and more. Amazon, PLEASE make this again or an ‘identical’ item! Note: I gave this 3 stars because of the combination of the item (5*’s) and the fact that it’s no longer available (0*’s). Speaker is not good. But I did get the night light that is nice but could have done better on speaker I thought this was the coolest addition to our Alexa devices... BUT The sound is horrible; it sounds like a busted speaker or a faulty ear piece. The sound has no type of tone or roundness to it. Very disappointing. You have to speak loudly for voice recognition also. I’m disappointed when I was so excited to add this device.",0.2222222222222222,4
B07MWCNR3W,3,5.0,0,3,"Great earphones. I use them like every day. As long as you take care of them and clean them out and stuff, they'll last you a good while. The sound quality is good and I love all the functions it has. Plus, the app that goes with it that you automatically have in a Samsung phone makes it even better. You can change the functions and equalizer among other things. I recommend getting a case for these though, as the case is smooth, so it can slip out of your grip or whatever and they can fall. Getting a case for these is a good investment. Aside from that, I don't really have any cons. Great headphones. Convenient, and have a good battery life. Initially I purchased these as refurbs, sadly that didn't work out so well. However I liked them so much that I purchased new after Amazon took care of me.<br /><br />If you're looking for audiophile sound, look elsewhere. If you're looking for good quality sound, easy pairing, and comfort than I've found these to be a perfect choice. I wear them for about 2-3 hours at a time at work, never feel fatigued by them. I find they stay in with little effort and range is good, as I often walk away from my desk. My wife uses hers at work as well but only with 1 bud at a time. She agrees the quality is better than the airpods she has as well.<br /><br />Like I said, if you're interested in audiophile quality sound, then you'll need to look at other choices. I've found that these seal well an keep most ambient noise out, although there is a setting that allows a touch to let more in. Touch controls weren't the best at first but updates have pretty much got them spot on. Only occasionally do I have it register a single tap instead of a double.<br /><br />Somewhat durable, I've dropped mine once or twice with no issues.<br /><br />Overall a good choice. I had a samsung galaxy 8+ when I purchased these and BOY-OH-BOY did these rock my socks! The features are sooooo great with the galaxy. Well, now I have an iPhone (yuck) and the features are not compatible with this stupid phone so they’re just another pair of bluetooth headphones. Don’t get me wrong, they still rock my socks as far as sound quality, durability, overall quality goes BUT zero features, zero special app, zero-ness. Sigh. Iphone sucks, not these headphones.",0.0,3
B07NM3RSRQ,5,4.8,0,5,"I really like the design, sound and functionality of the headphones and to be honest I really don't dislike anything about these headphones I mean for a $40 that's a steal from anker products and i have the bose qc25 and I could say I'm not really an audiophile but I do know which sounds good and which sounds great so i really couldn't distinguish anything between the bose and the anker and I paid about $299 3 years ago and I paid $40 for anker so do the math and I'm pretty sure if someone is leaving a negative review which I hope are honest cause for $40 it sums it all and to be honest I want to buy more, so my whole family can get one each and that's how confidence I'm about the anker and finally in my last sum up I wanted to talk about the battery i mean wow 40 hours depending on the NC is off or on so that's just amazing. Thanks anker and I bought the headphone with my own money and anker did not send me anything for free this is all me and I'm not really a review writer where you have 3 pages of review I'm just a sums up guy.<br /><br />On 12.31.19<br />After testing it for 2 weeks I found some cons but very minimal and everything good.<br /><br />The good<br />The sound quality gets better the more you use it the better it gets so they require certain amount of burn ins.<br /><br />As far as noise cancelling it is doing what it suppose to I mean I paid like $40 for the amount of perks I got on these the high resolution audio codec is enough for me to like these headphones lot.<br /><br />The bad<br />It's a small price to pay but it only happens when ANC is turned on so while I have the headphones on my head and I tried to close the door on the car I hear a static noise o don't know if it's a hardware issue or software it's just happens for that second but you definitely hear it and also when your adjusting the headband for headphones than you will hear it too again it doesn't bother me maybe it will bother some people. Also I really haven't tested the headphones while walking or in the wind haven't had that situation yet so once I test them while it's windy and or when j walk I'll write it down. Again for $40 this doesn't bother me I'll use this while sitting down if I have to I'll use my bose for walking and windy situation, but I really like the headphones.<br /><br />Updated!!!!!!!1.13.2020<br />I spoke to anker about the popping noise when I adjust the headband it only happens when ANC is active and you also hear the noise when you close the car door and also happens if their is a bump on the road so anyway I emailed anker and they stated that the updated version doesn't make that noise and that we as anker will send new headphones and return the defective one back so that's what I did and if anyone has the same problem just contact anker and they will send a prepaid postage and once they know the headphones is reroute they will send tracking number for a new headphones and yes I received it today and yes the popping noise is their no more yesss!!! Anker goes above and beyond to take care of their customers and now they have a long life customer and will continue to buy anker products and of their is any issues with it just a email will resolve the problem that your having. Thank you anker. All I can say is WOW! The sound on these headphones are excellent and has plenty of bass. The noise canceling also works very well. When it's on, I can't hear my wife. ;-) It allows you to fully enjoy what you're listening to. As for comfort, I can't say you forget you're wearing the, but you won't mind having these on for an extended period of time. I didn't suffer  the discomfort I felt with other brands after a while. I was able to use them all day, which also says something about the battery life. I highly recommend these headphones. Excellent quality of noice cancellation and sound.  I was also very impressed with the life of the battery, lasting longer than any other wireless  product I’ve used. And for the price, compared to other wireless headphones, this is a no brainer. The build quality, sound quality, wireless connection strength, and battery life of these headphones is incredible. I think that they are the best value headphones I've every bought. They sounds as good as my Senn HD280s.<br /><br />The only downside is that the active noise cancellation doesn't work nearly as well as some systems I've tested (Here One Earbuds, Airpod Pro, Bose QC), but does cut out most consistent noise. I was not ready to invest in a set of Apple, Bose, or Sony headphones, yet I was afraid to buy the cheapest headphones available. i wanted something that wouldn't ruin my music, or break the bank, and based upon other reviews, I believe I found a happy medium with these Anker headphones The bass doesn't sound over amplified, or pushed and it has a nice balance in the mid and high ranges.<br /><br />At first I used it with my phone, and was terribly disappointed, but on my computer and other bluetooth sound systems, they sounded fantastic. I later learned I would have to re download my entire Apple Music library to enjoy higher bit rate music, so I primarily use these with other devices.<br /><br />The battery life it amazing. I have not had to charge them in almost a month after daily use of an hour or so. When the battery does get low it takes only a few minutes to get hours of use thanks to its quick charge technology.<br /><br />They are lightweight, comfortable, and the sound quality is surprising decent for an inexpensive set of headphones. About my only complaint would be that the controls are not as intuitive as I would like, but overall I am very pleased with this purchase, and would highly recommend them.",0.0,3
B07PC7JKSB,3,5.0,0,3,"I ordered these Bose Frames Audio Sunglasses, Rondo, Black - with Bluetooth Connectivity for my wife as she loves her Sunglasses and listening to music while on the go. Before I handed them off to her, I paired them up with my Android device and played around with them a bit (so that I could show her how they worked of course haha) My fist impressions were how amazing they sounded without having actual earbuds. The sound is crisp but definitely not loud and booming as the speakers don't fit into your ears however for what these are, and meant to used for, they perform quite well. Don't expect an ""immersive"" experience with these, but more of an ""awareness"" experience, to where you can enjoy your music on the go and still experience the world around you. Call quality was decent and others can hear you clearly unless you are in a noisy or windy environment but this is pretty normal for most Bluetooth headphones. I never experienced any issues with the sound ""dropping out"" in either speaker and neither has my wife. As for the construction of the sunglasses themselves, I felt that they were well made and on par with a mid price ranged pair of sunglasses. The magnetic charging cable works great and I love to see this in more products as the Micro USB cables and ports seem to be the first thing to break. The cable it'self could be a little longer in my opinion but on the plus side it's less to get tangled and much easier to tuck away into the included soft pouch (which by the way works great to clean the lenses). My Daughter played with them for a bit using her iPhone and she was able to set them up on her own without any difficulty at all. The built in sensor knows when you take the Sunglasses off and stops the music which is nice so you don't have to worry about remembering to turn them off. Once you put them back on you have to push the easy to find button (bottom right front temple) and you will hear a battery status prompt and ""connected to"" prompt. Press the button again and your back to you're music. Bose has really thought these out and I found that they are quite intuitive and very functional. My wife loves them and my Daughter wants her own pair. Here are just a few of the things I really love about these audio sunglasses, in no particular order;<br /><br />1.  Super easy set up, like it took less then five minutes to get these ready to use.<br /><br />2.  Great sound quality, I worried this could be a redux of the wind up radio I got a few years ago, barely loud enough to understand, certainly not good enough  to listen to news on.<br /><br />3.  Classy, understated look that would look good on anyone.<br /><br />4.  They hold a charge for longer than I expected<br /><br />5.  Easy to charge, no pronged ended charging cable, these just have to be pressed against the gold dots on the inside of the sunglass arm, little magnets take hold and voila!  you are charging.<br /><br />6. I can wear these when I have a migraine.  I can't use earbugds when I feel that horrible.  The pain seems to spike if I touch the inner parts of my ears and down my jawline to add to my agony.  But these were great, no pain no nausea, no reason I can't pass the time with a fun book or listen to mosic.<br /><br />7.  The lenses are just dark enough that I can wear them even on the brightest summer day.<br /><br />8.  They came with a nice case that is big enough to hold the charging cable.<br /><br />9.  The bleed out sound when I am using these sunglasses is  very minimal.  I'm not botheirng anyone AND I can still hear what is going on around me.  When I have the sound turned down low the music seems like I'm in a room where someone is playing the stereo, low and I can have a conversation with someone without shouting.<br /><br />10.  I can leave my phone on my desk and head to the  kitchen for a snack and I can still hear my playlist. You put these on, connect them to your phone with Bluetooth and no one knows you are listening to music while you are strolling along. These have nice sound. I might just have to get my prescription sunglasses changed so that I can wear them in these. Then I can see well and hear excellently. I recommend these. My husband tried them on and he has a big head. I can wear them and they aren't too loose on me either.",0.0,3

I have one in every room in my house. Great for a lot of things. I love the Amazon Echo Dot products BUT there is a problem when using a wired headset plugged into the audio out when using Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones for Apple devices.  The audio only works if the plug is part way inserted. It's a rather hit-or-miss process.  The same problem exists for all Amazon tablets as well. I called Amazon tech support to see if there was an adaptor to assure a perfect fit for the audio out on Amazon devices &  iPhone specific wired headsets. The answer was NO. I appreciate Alexa's assistance but I'm most impressed with the sound that comes from this small speaker. Great bass. I also like Alexa's 'guard' feature. It's an added peace of mind. All around fantastic!",0.25,4

Nice and powerful. Highly recommended. Very fair price at $15 for a speaker that sounds good! Not very much bass at all but it’s loud enough outside to be heard clearly at a 30-40 FT distance, the battery lasts for a long time as well. I kind of bought it on a whim and I’m glad I did. The thing has a good battery life and is so simple to use. Enable Bluetooth on your phone, power on the speaker by holding down the button on the far left, and then find the device. Play whatever you want. Simple.",0.0,0

Easy to remove speakers and reciever,  Hand wash in baby shampoo, rinse, air dry, place speakers and pieces back in it is great for every day use. This bluetooth headband is an Excellent value for the price.  Easy to connect to any of my devices.  Great bluetooth range.<br /><br />I need to fall asleep to sound while my partner needs quiet.  These get the job done for both of us.  I can hear it well without him hearing it at all.  I'm able to pull it down over my eyes too, with near blackout to help sleep.<br /><br />I sleep on my side.  The internal speakers are right near your ear, so it can feel a little awkward at first.  But I quickly figured out how to adjust it and move around the speakers so that I don't feel them.<br /><br />Not super easy to remove and put back in the electronics for washing, but it can be done.<br /><br />Overall, would definitely buy again. [[VIDEOID:200164e88244479fbc429d9154ede107]] I love these new headband headphones. I wear them outside under my winter hat or even in place of it. I also use them for sleeping and sometimes exercise as well. Having this piece is so helpful since I don’t have to worry about losing my earbuds under my hat or taking off whatever I’m wearing in the cold just to change what I’m listening too. The sound quality and noise cancellation is actually pretty good. The fabric feels good and is comfortable after long period of time. I don’t love the look but its not terrible. My wife likes to use this to go to sleep but it gets pretty hot if you wear it indoors in my opinion. Also good for blocking out your life partner if they snore a lot !<br /><br />If you found my review or pictures interesting or helpful, please rate it as ""helpful.""

I can wear them for hours and they stay in place.",0.0,3
B07Q9MJKBV,4,4.0,0,4,"The overall sound is great - no complaints on sound. The biggest of all is that they dont translate well over to PC. Microphone is REALLY bad. People either cant hear me or they say i sound like im far away and in a can. Also cant get them to pair up with newer(2020/8 months old) Sony tv and has bluetooth capability. If these issues could be solved with software updates, they would simply be the best headphones I personally ever had. However my Logitech Pro X wireless(not bluetooth) headphones exceed the Bose 700 in all departments and cost over 50% less These headphones are terrible for conference calls. They do not cancel out background noise -- a delivery truck beeping several houses away is perfectly audible through them.<br /><br />They also have issues with picking up random static sounds, delivering choppy audio or speaking, and a myriad of minor annoyances that I should not have to deal with on $400 headphones.<br /><br />Otherwise, they look good are a okay for personal use. But when it comes to work or anything professional, I think their downsides are enough that I would definitely not buy them again. I had Sony WH-1000XM3, QuietComfort 35 Series I and II and 700 is the best for the following reasons:<br />1. Dedicated button<br />2. More responsive than Sony<br />3. Can connect to two Bluetooth devices at the same time! This is HUGE. Sony you need to disconnect from one and connect to another one. With Bose you don't have to do it. Whichever device is streaming audio Bose will connect to that one<br />4. Works at cold weather. Sony stopped working at a temperature close to 32 degrees by Fahrenheit.<br />5. Dedicated button for pausing, instead of covering ear cap and keep it held. Let me start off by saying, I've had the QC 15 and 20's. I've used Bose over the course of a decade for my travel. I wasn't planning on getting a new headset and was fine with my qc20 for a bit. But the gel like earbuds hurt after a long day of work. I happened to check out the sony mx4 during the prime day sale, but after watching the reviews online decided for the bose 700.<br />I use this about 8 hours a day. All of my calls are through my computer. I need something that's comfortable and can handle the extended use.  I got this because the sony had really bad reviews on the call quality.<br /><br />Call quality- no issues here. Given I'm using it in a small office with the hum of the AC.<br />Comfort- Extremely comfortable. The weight is minimal and doesn't give off that heavy sucking feeling after a few hours<br />Bass- It's ok. I'm not using it for hardcore bass anyways.<br />Noise cancellation-  My office is in my backyard.  With neighbors mowing their lawn throughout the day. This has helped filter it out.<br />Bose app seems pretty cool. But since it's connected to my laptop, I haven't had time to tinker with the settings.<br />Controls- I'm used to tactile buttons, but am not opposed to this.<br /><br />I have a few trips coming up and I'll test these on an airplane soon.",0.0,3

B07R5MKX3K,3,5.0,0,3,"Love these! Have yet to test out battery life but, sound is great bass is great. With coupons and discount these 49.99 headphones ended up costing me only $36.00!!! These are very well packed and overall nicely designed. I like that they went with a type C cable to charge them. Other earbuds I have used have gone with micro USB and that is definitely getting annoying to keep an extra cable on me. I really like the ability to charge these with the QI charger I have. That makes it convenient to charge at not android users houses. The sound quality is nice and honestly they are extremely easy to pair.<br /><br />Using them as a pair or as just one is easy. After pairing with your phone you can simply put the one you aren't using in the case. When you want to switch back to two you take is out and you will hear powering on and the sound will sync. The one downside I have found with earbuds in this price range is they don't offer the ability to sense when it's removed from your ear. This means when you want the earbud to turn off you'll need to put it in the case. The manual does a good job of explaining what tapping the side will do and you can also power them on and off holding down the side of it.<br /><br />Overall:<br />These are great set of earbuds and are being used as my daily pair at the moment. I will update this review if I have any issues. This EarFun Free earbuds sound is very good and connects easily upon selecting in your settings. The charge box is small and compact and easy to carry in your purse or pocket. It also stays charged for a long time!",0.0,3
B07RGZ5NKS,9,3.888888888888889,2,7,"I have tried so many earbuds from super expensive to these. This is the only ones I would recommend. They fight perfectly in your ear, I have not had them fall out. They are waterproof something the expensive ones never have. I use them at work with my phone, never had an issue with bad quality calls. I would give them 10 stars if I could. Stop buying those expensive ear buds and get yourself a pair of these. These headphones are great!  But the controls are a little wonky.  You are better off using the device rather then the headphones to control audio playback & pick up & answer calls.  But the sound is incredible.  The the way they sit comfortably & securely in your ear is awesome.  I would still recommend them if you need something with the controls in the headphones, in a pinch.  But Tozo does have better models!<br /><br />I have been made aware that my headphones may have been defective & will update my review after replacing my old headphones! These are a great pair of earbuds! I’ve had them a few weeks and the quality has been consistent. UPDATE: Nrw ones work fine after old ones couldn’t handle Windows 11.<br /><br />Really good earbuds only half good now after Windows 11 update. They connect but no sound. They still work on my iPhone but not on W11. Contacted Tozo and they say its up to Windows to come up with a fix. Don't think this is going to happen since this has a been a problem since June.<br /><br />So if you ever plan to update to Windows 11, skip this product. I bought a second pair in case I lost my current pair (I've been known to do that) and now they are pretty much useless too.<br /><br />----<br />Earlier Review:<br />Bought the T6 because it was on sale for the same price as the T10 with more features and it is the new model, plus I like the case better. You can put it on a wireless charger and this is the reason I chose them. Really? $25 bucks and it goes on a wireless charger? My old Apple Airpods don't do that.<br /><br />The sound is impressive, much better than I expected. Also better than Apple airpods. I can only assume Apple's Pro model has also improved.  On the T-6, I have to turn the damn things down sometimes. You can hear the symphony bass and treble and its full and rich.<br /><br />The controls are touch and work well once you learn them. Tap once to pause, again to play. Hold down for volume. Tap Twice for Forward on right bud and twice on left earbud for Reverse Also hold down for 10 count to activate pairing.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the Tozo 6 is how hard the magnetic airpods are to retrieve from the case. There is no easy way to find a grip to lift them. It takes several tries to get one, then the other out. Apple airpods can be difficult at times, but the magnet is stronger in the Tozo 6 and there is no logical spot to dislodge them with a finger. Still, I'm not taking off any stars for that. I think this is an excellent product.<br /><br />I bought these because I kept misplacing my airpods, I found them in the crevice of my recliner, but guess which ones I use now. That's right, the T6 Tozo. They really are impressive and well built. Can't believe they sell as cheap as they do--although I see price increases on the horizon. Thinking of buying another pair in case I lose these. So far these earbuds sound SO much clearer than my older pair. Crystal clear and good sounds depth. Bluetooth doesn’t want to connect every time I’m trying. So what’s the point of me spending 30$ for something that doesn’t work well!! For the price these are the best earbuds I have ever used. I own the higher end buds and these are just as good if not better. Problems for the past 3 weeks now it is worse. Intermittent disconnects, reconnects, battery problems, now left side stopped working. The 2nd pair I bought for my girlfriend also has problems with sound & reconnecting.  The Base sound is mediocre compared to my old Senso BT and Sony headphones has much better sound compared to these. Cheap quality!! Some earbuds failed noise cancelling. This earbuds have great quality of the sounds, no noise.",0.2222222222222222,3
B07S5JVP78,3,5.0,0,3,"I like the wireless earbuds they allow the amount of freedom I need. The sound is great . On occasion I need long time use so I can use one ear bud and replace it with the other bud while it charges  Very pleased with my purchase and would reccomend. My first impression as soon as I put them into my ears” O my GOD!” . The clarity and sound are an AMAZING! I bought 3 other different brands of earbuds and returned them. None of them had this almost “Boss” quality, doesn’t matter how much it cost. In addition they came fully charged, multiple ear rubber pieces and charger. What else I could wish for?! Maybe “ One Buy, One Free”!!!!😅 I know I’m dreaming but girl could dream ! This is what I was waiting for, the play time lasts 2 hours, it because of the built in microphone the paranoid government requires that all headphones/headsets have a built in microphone. the price was a steal. I am definitely recommending these to a lot of people.<br />The instructions are in the white envelope.<br />Overall I am very proud with this product,",0.0,3
B07SHG4H92,3,5.0,0,3,"These headphones can get really loud. If you turn the music on and place them over you neck, you can hear the music from at least 4 feet away. They do charge quickly... it has taken no more than 20 minutes to fully charge them. They have a bass button which is nice to get a better quality of music, as artists intent for their music to be heard. The volume button can be used to change the music. They were easy to connect to an iphone XR. You can also talk on the phone with them and hear well on both ends. They fit well, but did make the ears a little hot, which may be from the cushioning. These also have great range. I placed my phone (that was connected to them) in my room and went out of my apartment and down to the first floor, outside and the connection did not mess up at all. Overall, for a low cost over the ear earphone, these are very impressive!  I've purchased and returned several in the 30-$100 range.  All with major issues w/ bluetooth, sound quality, and overall quality.<br /><br />If you are used to $200+ noise cancelling earphones, these are not in the same caliber, but are one of the best pair I've found that are under $200.<br /><br />Pros: Easy to connect to bluetooth,<br />Long range of bluetooth (able to walk about 40-60 feet away, and outside of the house).  (This was comparable to my AKG $300 pair).<br />Looks are nice<br />Quality of materials (while plastic) seem durable<br />Size of ear piece is much lager than most, and fits well over my ear! Better than the AKG's and other's I've tried.<br />Fast charge, and long battery life.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not noise cancelling. Things are quiet, but I prefer to hear a little road noise when I'm walking.  (so for me this is a plus).<br /><br />Overall, I think these are a great option, and are thinking about getting a second pair. The sound quality is EXCELLENT! These are extremely comfortable , adjustable to different head size, and they are sturdy. They fold up for storing and transporting . I wish they came with a Carrying bag or case. The headset come with a charging cord and a audio jack cord.

They are plain so they would work for anyone. I like that they are Microphone and Call Controller Compatible. I would recommend them. I really never have used earbuds much at all before.  I do take my iPhone or iPad with me when I am going to be sitting and waiting for Dr's offices or mechanic visits.  I like to watch videos but don't want to use the speaker function, so these earbuds work great for me to listen in private.<br /><br />I am sorry that I don't have much experience with other earbuds.  I can't compare this set to others but I like these and am happy with them.  They work great for what I need.<br /><br />I have no complaints with these and they are great for my own needs.  Thanks. You’ll need to plug these into your phone with the audio jack. This is NOT a lightning connector  and it is NOT wireless but if you can still use earbuds that plug in these fit fine and the sound is decent. I don’t think they are stable enough for a lot of moving around but if you are more or less stable, these will do the trick. Earbuds have enough options and I found them to be very comfortable.",0.0,3
B07T6HCNVT,3,5.0,0,3,"This is the first time I’ve used headphones that are actually compatible with the iPhone 8… Without using a dongle attachment. I did not realize how obnoxious that small adapting piece could be… Especially, if you have a dongle that for some unknown reason- tends to short out on you!? (Really Apple- is this the best you’ve got... the best solution for a phone that costs more then, my first car… And you make us use an adapter- no less, called a dongle?!!!) The other fun involved with the dongle, it is trying to find it…for some reason, mine is never where I think I put it. Ha! Well, this set of headphones made these issues obsolete and I swear I would recommend you get this on that feature alone! IPHONE 8+ COMPATIBLE... Woo-Hoo!!<br /><br />As for the sound quality- I’m a mom in my 40’s and believe it or not, my tastes in music are awesome and I do appreciate listening to some kickass music! (I personally believe, I’m a student of the truest form of rock ‘n’ roll… and  I also must say- the best test for sound quality- is always done listening to Queen. RIP Freddie Mercury!) Im not a perfectionist who needs a sound so superior, it’s like sitting in the recording studio with the boys... Let’s be honest, these are a wired pair of headphones, connected to a cell phone! What I want is something reliable that relays good quality sound (equivalent to listening to music in my car.)  If I’m expecting anything else then, I better shell out high $$$ on the top brands.. and we know it’s not uncommon for some to spend $200-$500 on headphones!<br />But, if looking for a new pair of headphones, these sound far above average- and surprisingly, they’re quite good at noise canceling those around you. I most often use when headed to the pool or, on the infamous road trip with the kids. Since we all weren’t born with a high tolerance for rap music in this world.. I found these to be salvation! Other headphones I’ve previously used- Apple brand (came with the phone) and skull candy-  neither, would I complain about the output/sound performance…Ha! That is until I heard the quality difference with this pair. To be fair, the Apple set had issues from the beginning with the dongle-<br /><br />With this headphone, all notes in the music sound crisp and defined...  and even when turned up a bit louder, I didnt notice any of the Vibration noise that some like to pretend is sort of like the base!<br /><br />I’m not sure how or why... or, even what it is that make the sound quality so much better- and truly, for such a lament user of headphones.. I really don’t care why!! I just want a set with good reviews and to order with confidence, expecting to have the same positive experience. I know, I’m not alone when I say; if I spend time/$ to get an item, I want it to work and work well- Boom! these do.. Both, in construction and sound quality.<br />My one complaint would be the lack of comfort with the earpiece after wearing for a long period of time. (watch out if you fall asleep listening to music and these are still in place..I swear I bruised my ear and I didn’t even realize that was a thing?!) the way the clip rides around your ear to keep it in place- seems to bend my ear in a funny way. I will share with you- I did a life hack and fixed the sore spot with a piece of Kleenex- it looked 100% stupid but, it helped with wearing them on the 5 hr. Car ride-<br />I suggest just to be sure- you try the clip over the ear to see that it’s a comfortable fit, if you decide to<br />purchase…(and for all I know, the problem could be the shape/size of my ear?!)<br />Im definitely happy with the headphones overall and I’m certain they’ll be my new “go too” pair . While I tend to use wireless headphones most of the time, there are times, such as when flying that I need wired headphones and these are AWESOME.<br /><br />These headphones are equipped with an iPhone Lightning Connector which is the perfect size to fit through the opening in the case on my iPhone, it snaps into place without issue and provides a stable connection.<br /><br />The set comes with the headphones, a rubber squeeze case, 3 sets of silicone ear bud tips, 3 sets of silicone ear bud wings, and a wire clip.<br /><br />I found that the preinstalled tips and wings (medium) fit perfectly for me.<br /><br />The sound from these headphones is excellent - from the rich bass notes to the vibrant midtones to the bright treble.  I tested these headphones with a wide range of audio - from audiobooks to jazz, heavy metal, country, classical and blues - everything sounded amazing.<br /><br />The noise cancelling feature works really well on these headphones.  Noise cancelling is a complex process where a processor must detect ambient noise, both frequency and amplitude, through the microphone and then “block it” by creating an exactly opposite noise thus cancelling out the ambient noise.  Some noises are more easily cancelled than others and some processors within headphones do a better job at cancelling than others.  I have to say I am thoroughly impressed with the noise cancelling these headphones achieve.<br /><br />The microphone picks up perfectly on calls in my tests the other person had no issues hearing me crystal clear.<br /><br />The control module allows you to easily increase or decrease the volume.  Start / stop / pause music or answer / end calls.<br /><br />These are a great set of wired headphones that performed very well in all of my tests.  This is definitely a product I would recommend.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

The one time I took it outside and cranked up the volume, it did great, but I would like to have had a bit more base. I love this cute bluetooth speaker! It puts out good sound and I use it in my living room so I can listen to my own music. Great sound and easy to use. There are lights that indicate its functions so read the directions that come with the speaker so you know how to use properly. Simple setup and battery life seems to be good. It syncs with your devices very easily too. This speaker is so cute in pink! It has several light functions and the sound quality is amazing for such a small device. First of all it is easy to pair, and the volume dial is like a iPod- you “dial” up or down on a circle controller. It has buttons to kip or repeat songs. The volume degree is immense- you can use your phone to turn it up and then the speaker itself for even more volume! I have yet to hear distortion of sound even at its loudest. It charges super quick and lasts forever! I would definitely buy one as a gift for someone.<br />If you found this review helpful at all please let Amazon know by clicking on the button below!

B07VTK654B,9,2.7777777777777777,5,4,"What a piece of junk, has never worked, tried everything possible. Too late for a refund.<br />This is the only Amazon product I have bought that failed me. Simply wont connect to the car or my truck via Bluetooth This is a great idea for an older car with no Bluetooth. 2008 equinox for reference. It does have the required auxiliary cord input.  I love how small it is, and it has all the functions my regular Alexa echo dot has. The only thing I don't like is that you have to keep it plugged in, it is not rechargeable. Also the USB cord it comes with is pretty short.  Otherwise it's great For a friend who has an older model car, did not have Bluetooth in it. She had tried numerous other options. That did not work. She liked it so well I purchased another for a friend for Christmas who's minivan also does not have Bluetooth. The only problem is sometimes the volume is up too loud and her car and there is an echo. She has a blast with it, can ask it questions, get the news. and she was very excited to find out that she would be able to listen to her apple music.  Google maps is a breeze I bought this because I needed a way to make speakerphone calls in my vehicle, and the mic on my phone didn't pick up my voice that well. It does an amazing job as a speakerphone. While I've had it, I've started to use Alexa to do things like add things to my shopping and other lists, play music, navigate to addresses, and more. While not 100% perfect, it is really quite good at doing all of the tasks that I've asked it to do.<br /><br />I've been extremely happy with my Echo Auto purchase! This is a great way to update an older vehicle with an AUX port. I wanted this because my car bluetooth unit doesn't seem to like to call certain of my friends... it won't recognize their names over and over.  I had hoped this would be the fix since I use my home echos consistently.  I have tried multiple times to connect and use without luck.  I have tried at least 4 times and while I'm not a techie, I regularly install and use my tech devices.  It seems to connect and then later says it has lost the phone connection.  Maybe it is the phone.  So, when I get a new phone, I will update this review with, hopefully, a better one.  In the meantime, I'm taking it out of the car to sit uselessly on a shelf. This is by far the worst device ever made.<br />1. It has Bluetooth yet it can't connect to car stereo, it has to go thru phone's Bluetooth to Car connection.<br />2. Sound quality is very disappointing.<br />Even when using the cable and aux port quality is lacking.<br />3. Device can't be used to play music uninterrupted. Every time a phone rings, you are on a call or receive sms or email music playback gets interrupted.<br />You are better of getting echo input and connecting to phone's built in hot spot.<br />Do not buy this junk as it is pretty useless.<br />Maybe in the future when they fix software and all these glitches but not now. I love it when it works. However it disconnects frequently from the car Bluetooth. It is annoying when it stops functioning because it is describing an app and then it hears itself say “Alexa” and then stops doing what it is doing. It really needs to be able to change the wake work.<br /><br />I do not like that I can’t give authorization to make purchases and for some functions it will tell me to go to the app to do something. I don’t have access to the app while driving so that is annoying.<br /><br />When it works, it provides some nice entertainment-some games and apps that can keep me entertained while sitting in traffic. However, I think it has many improvements and if I had not gotten it as an early bird adopter, I would not have been happy with the current price for what it can do. I have Bluetooth audio in my vehicle. This Alexa Auto is not plug and play even after setup is complete. Each time I start the car, I have to change my input on my infotainment screen to Bluetooth Audio first. Then I have to have the Alexa app open on my phone! If I go to SiriusXM, Alexa won’t work again. What is the point of the device other than the additional microphones, when I can set the Alexa app on my phone to use the microphone on the phone. It’s too many steps each time to make it functional, but I think the worst thing is it won’t even play music that is locally on my phone! It only uses Amazon Music’s playlists.<br />This product unfortunately for me is a dud, and does not add any functionality to my vehicle that I don’t already have. I’m returning it. after having it for a few months, I would not recommend it. Unlike the Alexa in your home where you just speak, there are several conditions that just be in place for this to work. As a result, I never use it.<br /><br />However, as far as integration with my Toyota Prius goes ( and there is a very good chance this is Toyota), it is not as easy as the one you use at home. You must be on the right mode- for me it's the bluetooth mode. You won't hear it if you are tuned to am or fm.<br /><br />It is slower to respond. At home you say Alexa (baby pause) and then your request. In the car, it's Alexa (WAIT) . . . then speak your command. Half the time it dissolves into no response.<br /><br />As a result, I don't use it as much as I do the ones at home. And in case you think I'm a  rookie, I have 4 Echo products in my one bedroom condo. So I recommend it with reservation. I still want it, I don't want to return it, but it needs work, not sure who to blame.",0.5555555555555556,1
B07WMTLW2R,3,5.0,0,3,"This is a terrific monitor that is going to make my work day a lot easier. First of all at 27 inches it is huge. I included a picture to show you how much bigger the monitor is than a typical laptop screen. Also, the monitor does not have the glare that is created by my laptop screen. It's like the difference between a matte finish and a glossy finish on a paperback. The glossy finish starts to tire your eyes at the end of the day, and the matte finish keeps you fresh. I'm finding I don't have to take as many eye breaks with this new monitor.<br /><br />Installation is easy. The stand is solid and goes together without any tools. The TV also locks into the stand with no tools and has both a vertical and a tilt adjustment. There is a set of control keys along the side that allow you to make adjustments to the picture. I turned down the brightness to try to match the screen of my laptop. It came with a VGA cable, an audio cable, and a power cable. There is a HDMI plug in the back, but no HDMI cable was included with the purchase price.<br /><br />Note that you have to use the button on the side of the monitor to turn it on, not the switch located next to the power cable. This is a very nice monitor. This is a really nice monitor. Assembly was about as simple as it could be... you snap the arm into the back, then into the base. It took about a minute.<br /><br />I ran an hdmi cable from my 17"" laptop (see pictures) and turned it on. The image came right up, bright and clear... the only negative is that the speakers are a bit lacking. It probably deserves the loss of a half star due to that, but everything else about it is so good, I left it at 5 stars.<br /><br />Great monitor! I am a graphic designer and web developer on a budget and this Acer CB272 bmiprx 27"" Full HD Monitor is a great addition to my home office where I do the majority of my creative work.<br /><br />I have another large monitor connected to my MB Pro using an HDMI cable, but I have experienced issues with Photoshop unless my displays mirrored. This monitor has a VGA connection, and I believe that is the reason I can use this independently as a secondary display without my images blacking out. This monitor has 1 x Display Port, 1 x HDMI, 1 x VGA, 1 x Audio-in, 1 x Audio-out. VGA and audio cables are included,<br /><br />This frameless widescreen monitor has a small footprint and can pivot vertically. I think that's pretty nifty since I have never owned a monitor that could do that before. The screen height is adjustable to 4.7"", with a tilt angle of -5° to 20°, and 360° swivel for perfect viewing without fade I can adjust my screen when I adjust my position or change places.<br /><br />So far I have not experienced any light bleed along the edges and I will update this review if that happens over time.<br /><br />You don't have to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a high-quality display. Been there, done that and won't do it again because technology becomes much better and cheaper over time. I splurged on a twelve hundred dollar display several years ago and this monitor offers excellent image quality at a much more affordable price.<br /><br />My professional recommendation is... buy this monitor and go have fun with all the money you've saved.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

B07WSKKYPR,3,4.666666666666667,0,3,"These are decent, mid-range headphones. They're better than the cheap discount store ones, but if you're accustom to high end ones, you'll probably not be satisfied. I personally am accustomed to the cheap ones, so I think these are pretty good! The ear cups are okay and offer minimal comfort. The sound quality is above average. The controls are functional. It was easy enough to pair with my phone. They aren't noise canceling. As I said, they're decent, so I like them. When I talk to my friends for hours on end the last thing I want to do is hold my iPhone in my hand up to my ear or even be on speaker phone. My husband does not like hearing the speaker phone when he's trying to concentrate on his iPhone. It takes too much effort to talk on a speaker phone for hours. So as soon as I answer the phone I switch over to these headphones and talk through the microphone in the headphones. Perfect!<br /><br />My friend who calls me once a week sounds like a radio DJ, in fact he used to be one but the headphones make him sound that way just naturally. It is really cute. He's always had a nice voice but this makes him come through like rich stereo sound. At first I thought I was talking to a stranger, but got used to his new voice sound.<br /><br />You just have to hold the button down for a few seconds and an AI voice tells you what the headphones are doing. So if you are finished with the headset you just press the middle button and it tells you the headset is off. So that saves on battery power and makes it easy to know when the power is on or off. I find that I can make these the best volume easily and have it now where I don't need to change it at all.<br /><br />My friend who calls me every week told me about these headphones and I bought them on his recommendation. I had these years before I got an iPhone because I prepare ahead of time!!!! Now that I have a new iPhone 14 I'm happy as can be with my headset. Since the microphone is built in this is perfect for phone calls but it also works like a regular headphone if you want to listen to audio on your phone. I haven't started listening to music on it yet but will report back when I do. The sound is just superior to any headphones besides my AKG K553s.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review Love that the headphones rotate.",0.0,3
B07XJ8C8F5,9,4.222222222222222,1,8,"The sound quality is so much better than the other Echo dots even the Echo Show I have. The speakers are a lot nicer. I got it when it was a special that the colored light bulb came with it. My daughter loves the light bulb. She loves how it changes colors and the whole room changes that color. It is nice how Alexa will turn the light one when asked. Fantastic little speaker with quality sound and Alexa voice controls Sounds good for a small speaker, I have 2 of them connected to a sub woofer for my fire tv stick. this is honestly my first time knowing about echo products and this speaker exceeds all of my needs. the music sounds great. jazz sounds great, gospel music sounds great, R&B sounds fantastic… you won’t be disappointed. So I have several large speaker Alexa devices, but due to scalpers, those aren't available currently. So I bought this instead. The sound quality is crackly and awful. It's not very loud either. The sound is very tinny and just sounds bad. Anyway, it was only $20 so I'm not too mad about it. The Echo dot was a great value. Overall a great way to ask Alexa anything, no connectivity issues, volume adjustments are easy to spot and the shape of it is fun looking.  There is a light ring on the bottom for different indications, which I've only remembered green is ""you have notifications"".  Still learning but the set up was quick and easy.  My only gripe would be the sound quality when playing music.  I know this isn't a Bose speaker but I expected a little better than it is.  All in all I would get another one, if only for the convenience of being hands free. So far so good. I purchased the echo dot and singled light bulb combo that was discounted on prime day and both were easy to set up. Just screw the light bulb into the lamp and ask Alexa to find devices and she will recognize the new bulb. The color range on the bulb is nice and includes daylight, soft white and orange settings- orange ends up being more of an amber sepia light. Some people complained about the white cord on the charcoal echo dot but I love it because it hides the cord up against a white wall. I like that this dot also has an easy access mute microphone feature. Perfect for the corner of my bedroom. This is my third echo dot 4th gen. We also have a 3rd gen we use for weather and notifications. The 4th gens (especially those with a clock) are perfect for the bedroom. Music sounds pretty good and voice recognition is great. This particular dot we use in the master bath and it's a massive improvement over the old Sony speaker we used to use. I'm a pleased customer. Not impressed with the new generation. This one keeps going mute to the point that I have to unplug it to get it to reboot before it will play anything through the speaker. Now today it evidently can't connect to wifi. I just have a circling blue light, and it doesn't acknowledge being talked to. Liked the previous generation much more.<br /><br />After tech support helped, it worked normally for about two days. This dot isn't worth the money. Maybe they should do a little testing before they release a new product.",0.1111111111111111,4
B07ZMV33SZ,3,4.333333333333333,0,3,"I am pleased that this has a much longer range than a similar item I paid a lot more for. I still haven't mounted it permanently because I want to be sure it's in a good place for the sun. I like that the receiver plugs into the wall and can be placed out of view.  Seems to hold a charge well too. I have been working out of detached workshop behind my house & set this in front of my house to capture the circular drive. It's not excessively far but it's out of range for a bluetooth device reach. It rings if anything goes through the circle (where the Camaro is) or down the drive past the house. I have tested it by walking at the very edge of the drive & it hasn't failed to alert. I may adjust the settings down before I move the receiver inside because it picks up a lot of cat activity. I didn't realize how many neighborhood cats stroll through my drive early in the morning.<br />I wanted to check this out before I committed to a mounting place so I set it under that oak tree. I thought it might be too shady to maintain the solar power requirements but it's been there a week with no issues. It's so discrete I'll probably just keep it on the rocks & move it closer to the tree. The mounting hardware is pretty nice, though, with a ball-jointed mount that sets up easy since it comes apart & has a lot of adjustment.<br />The receiver has three or 4 chimes & none of them are subtle. It also has another 30 or so songs. Some are holiday themed which could be fun if you were expecting guests for a party. It has some public domain tunes from the Baroque & Renaissance period as well as some contemporary tunes like ""Music Box Dancer"". I currently have it on what sounds like a mariachi band playing ""March of the Toreadors"" from Carmen which is kind of hilarious but I can't imagine what maniac would want to be alerted by that in their house ever. Most of the rest of the songs are like that. This is my second set of these sensors. I have three sensors and two receivers. They work great. Very few false alarms. However, it’s tricky to set up. You need to go to their YouTube channel and watch the video if you’re planning to do some thing like my set up where you’re adding sensors to various receivers. Once they go through the process it’s easy to see how it’s done, but it’s not intuitive.",0.0,1
B07ZPC9QD4,3,3.3333333333333335,1,2,"This earbuds is definitely overpriced. The sound quality isn’t any better than other no name brands. and the battery life isn’t that good either. This product is almost perfect and probably could be if they fixed two issues. The first, and main, issue I faced was the microphone quality. I was extremely disappointed in the quality. People have repeatedly commented that I am very scratchy on calls and I’ve recorded myself multiple times on Voice Memos using these and the quality was subpar. They actually had worse quality than my iPhone’s built-in microphone and even the Lightning Connector Earpods that came with my phone. I’ve tried troubleshooting this multiple ways including, forgetting the device completely and pairing it again (exactly according to instructions in box) and turning my phone completely off and on again to no avail.<br />I also found that the volume level was somewhat lower than I expected. It isn’t extremely quiet, but to me it just seems a bit low.<br />Now, I don’t know if I am just unlucky and I’ve received a dud or if my expectations for this product are unreasonable, but I’d just like to see these problems resolved if not for my sake, then for the sake of others.<br />Other than those issues, I love the noise cancellation and the battery life is phenomenal. I'm a specs guys. Found it really difficult to spend any money on something like this but the sound upgrade in quality is worth it. While the battery life is not as long as the previous versions, I never found myself out of battery from listening to headphones 24/7 except when in the office. In that case I had only had them in for noise cancelling. Funny story a sales manager told me to turn them down once so she could continue ranting and raving while talking over everyone around her. Now that I have these noise cancelling head phones and get to work from home everyday until at least 2022 (fingers crossed) this won't ever be a problem anymore. They are great for blocking out sound from bathroom toilets flushing when hard at work tho in an office setting I don't feel I should be subjected to sitting directly near the toilets anyway. What can I say, whether blocking out rude sales managers or toilet flushing these are the best. Great for gaming too, I find myself x10 better when focused and not even noticing loud stomping, yelling, or other peoples phone conversations when I have these in.",0.3333333333333333,3

Paid $10.99, but now it's over $18. Worth the $10 bucks I paid and great as a backup pair to my other high-quality earbuds. It's an ok pair for the money, but don't compare to upscale brands or quality. You get what you pay for. Great for kids gaming or travel. Makes a cheap stocking stuffer as well.

B083ZP6988,3,4.666666666666667,0,3,"We live on 12 acres, and although we’re not planning a mini-Woodstock, we will be streaming movies outside this summer for our guests.  We have a whing-ding coming up when 30 family and friends will be visiting to help us plant our first crop - they’ll be tented around the property and we’ll gather for music and movies.  What appealed to me was being able to hook up to any device - and also the claim of “mind-bending” bass!  Music makes the work go faster, so we’ll want our fields to rock!  Hoping this  wireless speaker will give us the background noise we need!  Will amend this review with the results! Our family is a bunch of speaker and ear phone fanatics.  Everyone has different likes and I tend to like a well balanced music.  Muffled really bugs me.<br /><br /> I wanted to have a nice balanced speaker that no one will take so I decided to get this one for ME.  It has a nice solid housing and I figured it was worth getting since my favorite speaker seems to get misplaced a lot.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a very solid speaker.  It is heavy duty and it has metal housing.  The sides are not as fragile as others I have used which sound this good.  It comes in a beautiful gift box which has cushioning and the typical Santana design to it.  The speaker itself is pretty heavy so it is not something you toss in your backpack and run off with.  It needs a bit more care than that.<br /><br />CHARGING<br />This has a USB charger that will take about 4 hours to charge it up with.  There is also a connection where you can get a FAST charger from the company, but you have to contact them for it.  The charging cable comes with it just need a USB outlet.  The directions warn to only use the original cable that comes with this to charge or there might be damage to the speaker. The voltage must be 5V with current rated at 115A.<br /><br />CAN THIS RUN WHILE CHARGING?<br />I do not see in the instructions warnings against this, and it does work while plugged in.<br /><br />PLAY TIME<br />This speaker runs out of juice pretty quickly.  If you want it to last the entire time of 10 hours, I highly suggest you not put the volume up past 30%.  Any higher and the battery time runs down pretty quickly.  At 60% you are at the edge of running this down pretty quickly- as in 4 or 5 hours play time only.<br /><br />PAIRING<br />I have had no issues pairing this with tablets or phones using Android.  Just like when you turn the power on, it says PAIRING in a very loud voice so you will know when it is in pairing mode.<br /><br />VOLUME<br />The volume button on this is tricky.  If you are not thinking and just quickly press the volume once, instead of it getting slightly louder, you will skip a track.  You have to press the volume down and not let up if you want the sound to go up or down depending on the button you press meaning +/-.<br /><br />CARD SLOT<br />This speaker can also work off of a TF card (also known as a microSD card).  You just have to change from bluetooth mode to card mode using the MODE button.<br /><br />IS THERE AUX CAPABILITY?<br />I have an old MP3 player that has higher quality recordings than anything new I have. That only uses AUX and it works great with this.<br /><br />PAUSE / PLAY<br />You can pause or play music with this using the MFB button<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />Let me tell you, this thing ROCKS.  I mean it.  This speaker is fabulous.  Not only does it work great out of the box (after being fully charged) but it sounds better and better as you break it in.  It fills the house with music that is great quality and does not have interference or any lag issues either.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT BASS, MIDS AND HIGHS?<br />I have to say that this speaker is one of the few that I have used which does a beautiful job of intense bass, balanced clear highs but the mids are not muffled at all.  It is impressive and what I thought a speaker always should be.<br /><br />CAN YOU USE TWO TOGETHER?<br />This allows you to add one other speaker to the system so you can have them in two places.  I do not have another Europa speaker at the moment I can test that with.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this blows any other wireless speaker I have had out of the water, it does blow through power rather quickly unless the volume is pretty low.  It is not only amazing out of the box (After charging) but it gets better with more use.  This baby ROCKS.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Finding a speaker which does not overwhelm you with out of whack bass, piercing highs, or muffled middles is not always easy.  This speaker seems to divide it all out very well.  It is one of the nicest speakers I have used (wireless) to date.  FIVE STARS!<br /><br />Not only do I love this, but would definitely consider a second one along with the fast charger in the future to round out the whole system.<br /><br />ANOTHER THING<br />This product has a notification on it that some of the proceeds from this product will go to help underprivileged children through the MILAGRO foundation (miracle) that Carlos Santana and his family started in 1998. I ordered the 'Europa by Carlos Santana 40W Portable Bluetooth Surround True Wireless Stereo with 6 to 8 Hours of Continuous Playtime, Dual Active Subwoofer for Parties, Indoor & Outdoor - Black' for review and would like to share my thoughts.<br /><br />I have a few other portable Bluetooth speakers and this one is probably my most favorite. First off it really does sound great for what it is. The range is really good with the highs, mids and lows. The Lows or Bass is probably the best of all of the portable speakers that I own but I think that is mainly because this one is a bit larger than most of the others. It actually puts out some great sound. The pairing process was super simple and once done, it pairs up quickly to my android device every time. The design is nice and I like that although it's a bit larger (wider) than most of the other that I own, it's slimmer and fits easily under say my computer monitor or TV. The battery seems to last quite a while however I have never let is completely run out as I charge it pretty much after each use which might be for only 1-2 hours. With that said I can't say for how long the speaker would go before you get a dead battery. For my use it has been fine. I think that my biggest gripe is that it uses the Micro USB to charge it. In my opinion it should be using the USB C charging instead. Other than that, I love this speaker and think it is a pretty good value for a portable Bluetooth speaker.",0.0,0
B0856M2T37,4,3.25,2,2,"I paired this sound bar with our Sony XBR-65X850E 65” TV and it could not have been easier.<br /><br />While my TV would allow me to connect to the sound bar via Bluetooth I opted to connect via the HDMI ARC connection to avoid any sound lag.  In addition to these 2 connection options you can connect via optical cable.<br /><br />I followed the instructions - plugged the HDMI cable (included) into the ARC HDMI port, plugged the sound bar and subwoofer into the surge protector and turned everything on. The TV automatically recognized the soundbar and changed my output.<br /><br />The sound bar automatically connected to the subwoofer without me doing anything at all. I decided to move the subwoofer to another area of the room - I unplugged it, moved it, plugged it back in and it again reconnected without any problem.<br /><br />I was able to pair the system with my iPhone without any issue and the sound is stunning.  From the rich bass of the subwoofer, the vibrant midtones, to the crisp highs - every note is clear and distinct.<br /><br />While I have a true 5.1 surround system most of the TV broadcasts are not going to utilize that type of system and the sound is actually richer through this sound bar with a subwoofer.<br /><br />This soundbar can be easily wall mounted using the included template. Since I have my TV on an entertainment center base I’ve used the “AmazonBasics Universal Sound Bar TV Bracket - Adjustable Arm for Mounting Above or Under TV, Black” to mount the sound bar below the TV where it hangs perfectly level.  Since this is a universal bracket it requires a bit of figuring out the best configuration but it comes with everything you’ll need and it works great.<br /><br />The entire system is intuitive and user friendly. While many sound systems require hours to hook up and figure out how to use correctly this one is so straightforward. The remote doesn’t have a bunch of excess buttons that you’ll never need or use.<br /><br />The new sound technologies Sony employs with this sound system are incredible.  The “Immersive AE” function changes the directionality on the sound and is remarkable.<br /><br />In my instance my TV remote was able to control it immediately with no issues.<br /><br />I have always been impressed with the quality of Sony’s audio and video products - they are constantly innovating and improving on their products and in my experience they hold up far better than other brands.<br /><br />I highly recommend this soundbar for anyone looking for an easy way to improve the quality of the sound from your TV - and you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the rich sound it will deliver regardless of what you play through it.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.  I enjoy writing them as I value reading other’s reviews when I’m making a buying decision.  I regularly update my reviews to reflect any changes I may discover and to include helpful tips you may need if you purchase the product.  I will always make every effort to answer any questions I can as it is my pleasure to help. Voices lack clarity and its hard to make out what is being spoken at many instances. I connected AppleTV to eARC input of speaker and hdmi out to the TV. Still no improvement in voice quality even with Voice enhancement option turned ON. Although I didn't purchase this one from Amazon ,I had it for a few days and had to return it. I wasn't at all impressed and it left much better be desired. It is difficult to hear the sound of people talking while watching regular shows a movies as there's a muffled sound to me. The whole system, esp the subwoofer, also seemed underpowered in my opinion. This Sony Soundbar with subwoofer sounds great! EASY to set up and use. My tv does not have the correct bluetooth for this soundbar but setting up with the supplied HDMI cable was a breeze. The controls have a small learning curve but easy enough to get up and running quickly. The package contains the soundbar, subwoofer, two power supply cables, the remote with batteries, an HDMI cable and all the instructions and warranty cards. The remote is easy to operate and the controls on the soundbar and subwoofer are also a snap to use. You can set the center speaker on a higher volume so the dialog is much easier to hear for us hard of hearing folks (thanks Sony). Connecting the subwoofer to the soundbar via bluetooth was super easy. The Immersive Av function really fills the room with great sound and there are several settings via the remote for cinema, standard etc.. The only nit I have to pick is I think the subwoofer could be a bit more robust but I just received the unit and have not learned all of the adjustments yet so I will try to update when I have mastered it to see if I can increase it's output. I would highly recommend this unit.",0.5,2
B085XSRGPV,3,3.0,1,2,"Let's get one thing straight right away: THESE ARE NOT SUNGLASSES.  They are blue-light blocking at best, or just mildly tinted most likely. I took them out of the box and thought ""Oh cool! These are the kinds of glasses that get dark outside and transparent when you are inside!"", but nope- I wore them for a full hour outside and they didn't get any darker or exhibit any sun blocking properties AT ALL. So that's false advertising right there. They aren't for use in the sun. They don't darken anything.<br />As far as audio quality... they are a cool concept, but again, falls short of expectations. The open ear design means the speakers have to work harder to be audible. That means they often make those tin-sounding rattles that tiny speakers make when cranked up too high. This is definitely NOT cool for music as most of the fidelity is lost right off the bat, and adding insult to injury is that they often don't get loud enough to use outside. I'm not saying using it in a crowded subway terminal (that you can just forget about completely), I'm talking about even just going for a stroll around my suburban block with some birds chirping and the wind blowing lightly, maybe a car driving in the distance. I tried listening to a recorded lecture (since music was a lost cause), and they couldn't get loud enough to hear clearly. The microphone for calls was OK in my test, so I guess they are cool as a way to take a phone call without wearing a headset, but that only works if you're wearing these anyway as sunglasses. They aren't sunglasses, so you wouldn't be wearing them anyway, and you wouldn't be wearing them for music, and you wouldn't be wearing them to make a phone call either because they rarely get loud enough unless you are home alone... in which case you can put your phone on speaker and avoid this whole mess.<br />In conclusion- its a good idea but executed poorly and does NOT live up to expectations. I'm surprised there are so many good reviews on this product. I can't think of a time I would use it. I spend a lot of time at the computer for work so I wear blue light glasses often. These for that were comfortable to wear. I get tired of wearing ear buds so having this as another option to listen to music while I work is really nice. The sound quality is pretty good, in fact better than I excepted it to be and better than many headphones I have. They are a bit bulky to wear but not too bad. Overall I feel like these are worth the money and if you spend a lot of time at the computer like myself they are a good investment. The glasses are fine for uv protection. They are not sun glasses. They pair fine with my iPad and I listen to podcasts, so the sound doesn't have to be pristine for that purpose. But when I listen to music, I want better audio. I like that these are water resistant but I wouldn't press the issue on that point. They need to make these true sunglasses with blue light protection. And improve the audio.",0.3333333333333333,3
B0863FR3S9,3,4.666666666666667,0,3,"I've heard a lot of wonderful things about the Sony noise cancelling sets like these, and let me tell you: it isn't just hype. The sound quality is excellent, and the noise cancelling is eerily amazing. I put it on my wife and kids with the noise cancelling off and then turned it on to demonstrate, and you can see each them suddenly smile like ""whoa"".  Like my Sony studio headphones I use professionally for work, the actual fidelity of the sound it reproduces is excellent, and the microphone for calls is excellent despite being up by my ears and so far from my mouth (other bluetooth headphones I've tried were good for music only, the mic being up by my ears wasn't good enough to isolate my voice from ambient sound, but this definitely does a great job).<br />The app gives a ton of control beyond what I expected to really customize the experience. For example, I have mine set to auto-pause if the headphones are removed, and to turn off noise cancelling when it detects me speaking to someone, and then resume playback when the headphones are removed/replaced. These features are all customizable, as well as many more. But you need the app. And this is where the cons come in:<br />1) You really need the app to get the most out of this. I was thinking about pairing this with my desktop and/or TV, but without the app you have far less control, and to be honest I couldn't even get it to pair with my phone using just Bluetooth alone. There seems to be a way according to the instructions, but I couldn't figure it out without using the app installed.<br />2) For a set that costs this much, I'm surprised at how scuffed up it got after one fall from about 3 feet next to my car. Including pictures. This happened the day I got it. I'm not sure if there's anything that can be done about that, pavement is hard to recover from if anything is dropped, but it's something to keep in mind if you're spending this much money on a gadget. My studio headphones have been roughed around for years and held up fine.<br /><br />All in all, I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't so reliant on the app to get the features going and/or more resilient to being dropped. Feels like I should deduct one for that. But as far as features and sound quality go, this is a solid 5 out of 5. These work great on airplanes and you can’t even hear the blaring announcements. And you just put your palm against the right headphone to be able to hear ambient noise. You can control the volume and skip tracks just by swiping the right headphone. Easy blue tooth connection. So, a lot of people complained about the headphones pausing for voice etc.. there's an app you can download where you can turn off auto pausing, auto turn off, and you can even turn off the noise cancelling. I personally can't handle the noise cancelling aspect, as it hurts my ears and gives me weird head pressure.. so I'm super happy I can turn that off.<br /><br />My headphones lasted about 3 days, listening about 4-6 hours per day. The headphones only take about 30 minutes to charge as well.<br />They are suuuuuper comfortable.<br /><br />I am a smaller person, and a big issue I have with most headphones is they're way too big for my head, so I can't lean my head back onto the bed or couch with them on.<br />Not with these! I can lean my head back FINALLY, and I barely feel like I'm wearing them.<br /><br />I had beats before this, and they hurt my ears and my head because they were so weirdly shaped and tight. Like my ears would literally fall asleep. I seriously don't even notice I'm wearing them. No tightness, no pressure, no ears falling asleep.<br /><br />The case they come with is high quality, and it comes with an aux cord in case you want to listen that way!<br /><br />The sound cancelling is... Amazing. Literally no sound got through. I thought my husband was messing with me and just mouthing words at me, but no.. he was speaking quite loudly.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommend. Probably my favorite out of all the ones I've tried.. and I've tried about 7 just this past year.<br />Splurge and get them, you will not regret it.",0.0,3
B086STGJ49,4,4.5,0,4,"Ordered this for my son and his 17th birthday!! Chose this specifically because of the subwoofers and boy, you would’ve thought we had purchased an entire home stereo system… He was over the moon happiest with this gift- and mind you, he also received a new PS4 gaming station!!<br /><br />I was apprehensive how well the sub would sound in a small Bluetooth speaker and truly, it suits the needs we have perfectly. Those needs being… “I’m 17 with a few friends over (ha! Must remember we’re in the middle of COVID-19..!!) and we want to turn up music in my room, take the music to the pool… Or, just tell people we have our very own subwoofer! Sad but true, it’s all about bragging rights at this age… If this is any indication of the coolness factor, I’ve had two parents contact me asking what exactly was purchased to make us the coolest parents of the year!! That is The best endorsement I need.<br />As for functionality, I’m impressed the sound quality can turn an adequate size living room into a rave, mosh pit, country jamboree… Whatever your poison is- this speaker does not distort at the higher volume, which I was concerned about. The fact the music of choice happens to be mostly rap is another story… but, that is not the speakers fault it’s my sons poor taste in music!<br />As you can tell I am not a stereo guru or techie nope! Not in any capacity… I do know you can enter an SD card which was pretty impressive to the kids… I know they can lay tracks if that makes anyone feel better? Personally, I just made certain that had nothing to do with using drugs- and when I was assured it clearly wasn’t… I let them do their thing!<br />Great idea I want to toss out… We also chose a Bluetooth microphone that runs about the same price as the speaker- And.. as the kids listen to music they can karaoke of sorts… Using a lot of fun features the microphone has (Voice distortion, echo, voice enhancing.. truly the ability to make anyone sound better than they do!) I mention this because, together these two items have created such a fun source of entertainment for the small crowd… And during the quarantine I will take it all day long!<br />At night- my son plugs in the speaker so it’s fully charged and they have used it for a few hours at a time without any issue a battery‘s dying… Note, if next to an outlet you could also keep speaker plugged in and use it just the same. Technically, if plugged in this could run 24/7- but, not sure you want to torture yourself that way!?<br />I will admit, this does remind me a little bit of my old high school days in the 80’s.. when we would carry around a “boom box” on our shoulder- yep! You never knew when you needed to have a break dancing riff-off..!! The only thing different is, this Bluetooth speaker is half the size! Looks the same but a mini me version..<br />If looking for something to listen to that produces decent sound quality and definitely gets a throaty base this is it! Kids will appreciate it parents be warned-<br />I hope this info helps.. feel free to let me know! I have tested and reviewed literally hundreds of Bluetooth speakers and while I am not a fan of music that is particularly bass heavy I found this speaker produces rich, vibrant sounds from all wave lengths.  It produces more than ample volume for most any setting and has several connection methods.<br /><br />While I have tested and reviewed Bluetooth speakers costing ten times (and more) what this does, the sound quality from this speaker is really quite good.  In relation to the sound quality I would place them on par with mid to high end Bluetooth speakers.<br /><br />In regards to charging time and battery life, both are outstanding.  In my tests charging takes about approximately 2 hours to charge the built in 4000 mAh battery and the speaker lasts a solid 4.5 hours at max volume - 8 hour with volume midway (of course this will vary a bit due to exact settings).<br /><br />There are multiple ways to connect to this speaker including Bluetooth 5.0, which can reach much further than previous versions, through an AUX cable, a 3.5mm jack, TF card, USB flash drive, or FM radio - it even has a built in extendable antenna.<br /><br />While it has a remote and I tested it and it works fine, I rarely use it as I connect with my phone all the time.<br /><br />I have taken this speaker with me to the pool for the last couple of months and have been thoroughly impressed with its performance.  The battery, being 4000 mAh, is much longer lasting than most allowing for all day listening and the sound quality has been really good.<br /><br />This is an all around great Bluetooth speaker that I certainly recommend. I've owned many affordable bluetooth speakers, but never one this size! I love this, the sound quality is FAR BETTER than anything I've used in this price range. The woofers deliver solid bass, and the directions really help fill a space with sound. I love that it even has a carrying handle and a place to plop your phone onto (great for Karaoke!). I'm a little confused by the Mic input, I thought perhaps this could work as an alternative to the line in... for example, I can line in for music, but also sometimes I'd like a mic-level input for using with a microphone. But the mic input seems to only get used for some sort of recording to TF card function, which I couldn't get to work anyway. Doesn't matter, I wasn't so interested in that feature, I was more interested in using it as an amp and thought that might be an interesting alternative use.<br />Using the speaker for both bluetooth audio or wired aux in worked very well. The FM radio is nice too, but I didn't try it much. All in all, the battery life seems pretty solid and this thing is incredibly powerful for a battery operated speaker. We usually don't max out the volume because that's too loud! I ordered the 'Portable Bluetooth Speakers Bluetooth Wireless 100ft Outdoor Speaker with Double Subwoofer, Rich Stereo, Support FM Radio MP3 Player Remote AUX EQ, 30W Bluetooth Boombox for Home Yoga Party Camping' for review and would like to share some of my thoughts.<br /><br />First of all, I ordered this portable Bluetooth speaker more for the looks than anything else. I had recently remodeled my office  with a sort of industrial/steampunk look and thought this would look awesome on one of my new industrial book shelves. The speaker really does have that retro, industrial look and to top it off, it actually sounds and preforms quite well. The Bluetooth 5.0 pairing is super simple on my Android device and I appreciate that they did use the Bluetooth 5.0 tech opposed to the older outdated versions. This allows for insync listening to streaming services without the annoying delay that the other older versions have. Now with all that said, the sound quality is good but not amazing but for the price of this speaker, it's a bargain considering the input options, build quality, Bluetooth 5.0 and included remote. Overall I am quite happy with this speaker and it's looks and performance for the price!",0.0,0

It’s small and portable, so you can take anywhere. It holds it’s charge for awhile too. The sound quality is incredible for such a small speaker. The only thing is that the “light show” is not as bright as the picture looks, however that is not a big deal and it’s still a great product that I would recommend! Being out on our deck at night calls for music, and this wireless speaker delivers - plus, a little light show!  The sound quality is great, the battery lasts  a good long time and the whole thing is easy to set up with your smart phone.  It takes up almost no space and is easy to station it in the best location.  Good choice! For a moderately priced speaker I am very happy. Its versatile and sounds great. Does fine with water though I wouldn't suggest immerging it. Has great bass and the changing lights are a cool addition. Colors also appear to change with the beat of the song which is also really cool as well. Comes with a standard charging cable (micro usb) and and aux cable which is great if your bluetooth device stops working or you want to save phone battery. Overall, great buy",0.0,0
B089DR29T6,3,4.333333333333333,0,3,"I use it on a Living room floor lamp that is behind a large recliner. No more do I stretch dangerously to reach the lamp on/off switch. This is our first Amazon smart plug. Unfortunately the overhead light in our downstairs room, which we use as a library, doesn't work because there's the bottom half of a lightbulb stuck in it. (Yes, before  you ask, we tried using a broomstick. We even tried getting it out with pliers. We're going to have to get someone in to replace the socket.) I plugged this smart plug in, fiddled with the Alexa app, scanned the included QR code, and voila, I had the plug working. Not using it for anything complicated yet, like routines; I just classified it as a light. Then took it downstairs, plugged the lamp into it, and said to the Echo Dot, ""[name], turn on the lights."" And there is light. ""[name], turn off the lights"" reverses it.<br /><br />I need to figure out how to make the lights go on and off when I say ""Lumos"" and ""Nox,"" but for now it's great. No Stygian darkness down there if I enter when the other lamp on its timer is off. Easy peasy to set up. Once I plugged 🔌 it in, my Alexa app was able to see it and asked me for confirmation of the plug 🔌.  That was it! Now all I have to do is to tell Alexa to turn my lamp 🔦 off and on. I have multiple Echo Dots and each one is capable of turning my lamp 🔦 off and on. Love it!! 😎❤👍",0.0,4
B08BFVBLFY,3,4.666666666666667,0,3,"This is a whole lot bigger than portable battery powered ones in the same price range that sound the same (I've got several of those), so I don't think I would purchase this myself.  However, I had the chance to test it and it is a good speaker if you ignore the size and the lack of a battery for portability.  It took about 20 minutes to set up, half of which was because of poorly translated instructions.  But if you've ever used Bluetooth before, you'll figure it out before long.  I felt that it did what it promised, so I didn't take off any stars. I was looking for something to give adequate cinematic audio to our projector movie nights that won't break the bank. In the past I've tried various sound bars but have never been all that pleased with the quality coming out of them once we turn it up to fill the room. This product, however, is astounding for the money. It has a real 2.1 speaker system, as there are two sets of woofer/tweeters for the left and right channels, as well as a decent subwoofer at the base of the tower. Sure, the sound is all coming from the same location so you won't really get the surround sound effect of having L+R on opposite sides of the room, but the clarity of the sound reproduction on this is better than my old 2-speaker setup and far better than any sound bar I've tried yet. It gets LOUD if you need it to, but unlike other speakers which can get loud, it doesn't seem to distort the audio or lose the treble in the deep bass. This is likely thanks to the dedicated subwoofer at the foot of the tower complimenting the smaller speakers above it. You may have to play with the EQ buttons to get the optimal setting for your listening experience, but I'm so surprisingly happy with this product that I'd consider that a minor issue.<br />The speaker supports bluetooth as well as aux inputs and other standard sources for a speaker of this classification. I tried the AUX input with the Quad-DAC feature of my LG phone to really push the speakers, and I was very impressed with what I heard. Then I connected it via bluetooth to our Firestick and put that in the projector, and a clean wireless projector movie night was had with excellent cinema quality sound. I do wish there was a way I could buy a second one and split the channels for L and R for a proper stereo experience, but honestly, I'm really just so pleased with the sound from this for the price that I can't say enough about that. This speaker works great. I mostly use it for listening to music on my phone through the bluetooth function. I sometimes use it to charge phones too. It didnt work well with an S10 (it charged it slowly), but works well with an iphone XR for charging. I like the docking station for the phone, it's convenient. The sound quality is great, clear, and just the right amount of bass. It's not too heavy either and it's slim so it fits in small places.",0.0,0

Surround sound was too bulky for me, especially with my cats, so I tried a soundbar. This one was $40 with rave reviews, so I tried it. It was very easy to install with the good instructions. I used the optical cable. I can finally hear my tv. The remote immediately synced with my tv remote. I do have to turn the volume up every time I turn it on, but that's fine. Perfect fit under my computer monitors and takes up little space. Also the quality of sound is rather nice. Pairs very well with my existing speakers / bass combo. Also like the fact that I can bluetooth my phone to the speaker if I want to listen to something else while working on my PC. Directions were very helpful on how everything gets setup Sounds much better than the tv speakers. I bought a used one. Did not have remote batteries included (not a problem). The optical cord was defective. I contacted Amazon and they gave me a credit to buy another one.  I wasn't able to have it connect at first so be sure to hold the link button long enough for it to connect. I may get another one at some point.

This speaker was really good at first but then it became almost muddled. A few weeks later, it broke completely. (See video) I have no idea why it changed.. keep looking elsewhere. This is a piece of crap. I needed a speaker that I could plug into the TV through the USB port on the TV because my HDMI ports are in use.

It's super easy to charge, and I really like that when I start using them a little voice comes on and tells me how much battery life is left.

It is solidly constructed, 10 foot length gives some flexibility and it looks great.  We tried it with an iPhone 6 to a external speaker and it worked very well.  Good price, love the cable. I use headphones frequently in the office, and I have found that audio cables are often the weak link when it comes to headphones. I have gone through several cables just from daily wear and tear. I looked to this cable as a replacement for my last failed cable. So far I am pleased with it.<br /><br />I prefer nylon braided cables as they seem to be more durable and tend to last longer. They do have a tendency to be more stiff and inflexible, though. This particular cable has more flex than most other nylon braided cables I have used while it also feels more substantial. I have been pleasantly surprised with how much more flexible this cable is compared to most.<br /><br />The weak point in most cables is where the cable itself joins the connector. I have seen so many that have a rubbery, flimsy sleeve at the connector, and these have a tendency to rip before the cable connection fails. This particular cable has a nice, hard plastic sleeve instead, once that does have a small amount of flex but is hard and sturdy enough that it’s not going to rip or fail without deliberate effort to damage it.<br /><br />As a nice plus, I like that this cable is bright red where most others are plain black or white. There will be no confusing this cable for someone else’s in a shared environment. I have paired this cable with a set of Munitio PRO40 headphones and it works well and looks great.<br /><br />It’s another big plus that it comes in different sizes too, so you can choose the size you need.<br /><br />Sound quality with my cable appears to be unchanged from other cables I have tried - no buzz or hum with different electronics I have tried, no crackle or hiss. That’s really all I can ask.<br /><br />So far I have no complaints with this audio cable. It works well, appears to be made well and it is brightly colored which makes it stand out and distinguishable from most other audio cables I have seen and used. It is priced reasonably as well. Based on my experience with it so far this is an easy recommend. I wanted Alexa Auto in my 2006 Sequoia, but it is not equipped with bluetooth or the new tech.

B091XN41PN,3,4.0,0,3,"This is a nice little boombox that’s great for low to mid level sound with decent bass. Also has a cool light and can be paired with other doss speakers for fuller/louder sound. My review is based on the one DOSS party boom speaker. It’s light weight which may save your arm but probably contributes to distortion if you try to crank the volume. My biggest grip is there is no battery level indicator. I have a ION block rocker that $20 more than this is currently selling for. It cam with a microphone and the sound is better cranked up. It also tells you how much battery is left. The only thing the DOSS has over the ION is the lights, weight it’s $20 cheaper. Do your research find out which one works best for you. If $20 is a too much and you need something lighter with cool lighting than this box may be for you. [[VIDEOID:5ebb26c7410deeb3688014bde2b9cf77]] This sound pretty amazing and is very portable.  You can adjust the treble and bass too.  The built in rechargeable battery is extra handy.  It has a metal cover that really protects the speaker.  You can even hook up a guitar that is really cool.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-) I wanted to use this to project sound at a small corporate gathering.  Too small to use a full blown PA system, too big to use a standard bluetooth speaker. This is a really good in-between size! I was able to use the bluetooth mode to project music, as well as use a wireless mic system to project voice (using the hardwired receiver inputs on the back). The only thing is that the mic port on the back of this has some weird echo effect that I did not like. Thankfully the guitar port was very clean, so I switched the mic to that one.<br />It gets loud enough to get the job done, although I feel like I've gotten louder responses from other speakers this size before. It is still good enough for my intended purpose so I won't deduct any stars for that. The lights can be turned off if you don't like them, but they are pretty cool too. The only other caveat is that the buttons aren't easy to see. They are embossed rubber-on-rubber, and don't light up. So if you are in a dark room and trying to figure out which one is volume, it is more difficult than it should be to figure it out. I wish they had made those buttons more visible, either using a white text label or light up the buttons or something other than black-on-black buttons. But other than that, it's a great speaker, looks good and sounds pretty decent.<br />At 150 I'd argue there might be better options, but as of the time of this writing, the listing price is 99 dollars, which I think is worth it for a speaker with these features.",0.0,0
